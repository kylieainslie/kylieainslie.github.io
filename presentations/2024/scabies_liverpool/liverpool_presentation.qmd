# What even is scabies?

## *Sarcoptes scabiei*

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Scabies is a disease caused by infestation of the skin with a microscopic mite.
  - a.k.a. the Itch or seven-year itch
  - From the Latin *scabere*, meaning 'to scratch'.
- Symptoms are characterized by itchiness and rash at the site of infestation.

## How does scabies spread?

- Direct, extended, skin-to-skin contact
- Sharing clothing, towels, or bedding used by an infected person
  - Less common

# Do people still get scabies?

## Scabies Worldwide

-   Scabies affects around 400 million people per year.
-   Accounts for a large proportion of skin disease in many low- and middle-income countries

## Scabies in Europe (then)

- Scabies infections were a common affliction in Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s
    - Highest incidence seen in 1918 and 1945.

## Ok, so what's the big deal?

-   The global disease burden of scabies is low compared to other infectious diseases

-   Disease severity is also low - you're not going to die

-   BUT

-   Secondary infections can lead to severe outcomes

-   No simple diagnostic test for scabies

    -   diagnoses rely on clinical assessment (more GP visits)

-   scabies can have economic implications for both the patients and the healthcare system

## Serial Interval

- We calculate the index case-to-case (ICC) interval for each person,
  - **index case:** the person with the greatest value for number of days since symptom onset. 
  - **"secondary" cases:** have an ICC interval calculated as the number of days between their symptom onset day and the index case. 

## Serial Interval

::: nonincremental
- We use a maximum likelihood framework to determine how likely each ICC interval can be attributed to each transmission route

## Growth Rate
::::: columns

- To determine how the number of scabies cases is changing each year in NL we estimated the *annual* growth rate
  - Fit GLM to the annual number of scabies diagnoses per 1000 people.
- **Estimated an annual growth rate:** 0.25 (95% CI: 0.2, 0.3)

## Basic Reproduction Number $R_0$

-   We can relate the growth rate to the basic reproduction number as 
$$R_0 = \exp(r*T – (1/2) r^2 s^2)$$ 
    - $r$ is the annual growth rate, 
    - $T$ is the mean generation time (in years), and 
    - $s^2$ is the variance of the generation time distribution.

::: aside
**Assumption:** nearly everyone exposed has not been previously infected.

::: nonincremental
-   We can relate the growth rate to the basic reproduction number as 
$$R_0 = \exp(r*T – (1/2) r^2 s^2)$$ 
    - $r$ is the annual growth rate, 
    - $T$ is the mean ~~generation time~~ serial interval (in years), and 
    - $s^2$ is the variance of the ~~generation time~~ serial interval distribution.

-   This gives us an $R_0 = 1.09$ $(95\% CI: 1.07, 1.11)$

# Now what?

## Policy Implications

::::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
-   Scabies cases are increasing in the Netherlands.
-   Minimal control measures could decrease $R_0<1$, such as
    - educate age groups (adolescents and young adults) with highest prevalence of scabies about the causes and symptoms of scabies infections,
    - require a scabies check for university students prior to the school year, or
    - inform GPs about the higher risk of scabies in certain groups
        - could lead to quicker diagnoses

## This is only the beginning

- The epidemiological quantities estimated here can be used to parameterise mathematical models of scabies spread 
- There is still a lot that we don't know
  - Future work should focus on obtaining more precise estimates of the underlying quantities that govern scabies spread.

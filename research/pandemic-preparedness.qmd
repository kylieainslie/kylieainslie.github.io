## COVID-19 Pandemic Response {.section-header}

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I contributed to several major initiatives providing real-time epidemiological intelligence:

::: {.project-card}
### REACT Study (England)

The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study was one of the largest community surveillance programmes for SARS-CoV-2. Using repeated cross-sectional surveys of random samples of the population in England, we tracked infection prevalence and detected resurgences before they appeared in routine surveillance data.

### European Interventions Analysis

As part of the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team, we estimated the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 transmission across 11 European countries. This work, published in *Nature*, demonstrated that lockdowns substantially reduced transmission and prevented millions of deaths.

### China's Exit from Lockdown

We developed methods to track the success of China's exit from strict social distancing measures by analyzing the relationship between mobility data and transmission dynamics.

## ESCAPE Project {.section-header}

::: {.project-card}
The [**ESCAPE**](https://www.escapepandemics.com/) (European Surveillance and Control of Antimicrobial Resistant, Pandemic, and Epidemic Diseases) project aims to build European capacity for rapid response to future pandemic threats.

**Key objectives:**

- Developing standardised surveillance protocols
- Building modelling capacity across European institutions
- Creating frameworks for rapid data sharing during outbreaks
- Training the next generation of outbreak responders

## COVID-19 Pandemic Response {.section-header}

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I contributed to several major initiatives providing real-time epidemiological intelligence:

::: {.project-card}
### REACT Study (England)

The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study was one of the largest community surveillance programmes for SARS-CoV-2. Using repeated cross-sectional surveys of random samples of the population in England, we tracked infection prevalence and detected resurgences before they appeared in routine surveillance data.

### Mobility Data and COVID-19 Transmission

Mobile phone mobility data provided a near-real-time proxy for population-level social distancing behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used anonymised, aggregated crowd-level data to show that initial compliance with social distancing interventions in the UK was high and geographically consistent across regions. We also examined how mobility data could be used to monitor the success of countries exiting strict social distancing measures.

## ESCAPE Project {.section-header}

::: {.project-card}
The [**ESCAPE**](https://www.escapepandemics.com/) (European Surveillance and Control of Antimicrobial Resistant, Pandemic, and Epidemic Diseases) project aims to build European capacity for rapid response to future pandemic threats.

**Key objectives:**

- Developing standardised surveillance protocols
- Building modelling capacity across European institutions
- Creating frameworks for rapid data sharing during outbreaks
- Training the next generation of outbreak responders

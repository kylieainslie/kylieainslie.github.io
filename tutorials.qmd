<!-- ## About These Tutorials -->

<!-- These tutorials focus on practical skills for infectious disease research, covering statistical methods, mathematical modeling techniques, and reproducible workflow tools that I use in my research at RIVM and the University of Hong Kong. -->

<!-- Each tutorial includes: -->
<!-- - Step-by-step instructions with code examples -->
<!-- - Real-world applications to infectious disease problems   -->
<!-- - Reproducible examples you can run yourself -->
<!-- - Links to relevant resources and further reading -->

<!-- ## Upcoming Tutorials -->

<!-- I'm working on additional tutorials covering: -->
<!-- - **Agent-based modeling** for infectious disease transmission -->
<!-- - **Vaccine effectiveness analysis** from observational studies   -->
<!-- - **Bayesian methods** for epidemiological inference -->
<!-- - **Data visualization** for infectious disease data -->

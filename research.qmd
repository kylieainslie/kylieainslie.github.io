***Evaluation of WAning Vaccine Effectiveness (WAVE)***

Information regarding decreasing VE is essential to optimally design booster vaccination campaigns with respect to the risk of outbreaks and whether repeated vaccination is cost-effective and ethical. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the lack of robust methods to: assess waning vaccine effectiveness, disentangle true from perceived waning, and identify determinants of waning. In this project, we aim to develop and rigorously compare methods to assess waning vaccine-induced protection (for vaccines such as those against pertussis, influenza, and COVID-19). Using these methods, we will analyze data from observational studies to estimate the rate of waning vaccine effectiveness and determine how individual characteristics influence rate of waning vaccine-induced protection.

***Modelling the impact of vaccination strategies***

In this project, we use mathematical models of infectious disease transmission to determine the impact of vaccination strategies on disease spread. Specifically, we developed a deterministic age-structured compartmental model to compare different COVID-19 vaccination scenarios with respect to disease outcomes (e.g., infections, hospitalisations).

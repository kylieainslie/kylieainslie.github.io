# Abstract

**Background**

Following rapidly rising COVID-19 case numbers, England entered a national lockdown on 6 January 2021, with staged relaxations of restrictions from 8 March 2021 onwards.

**Aim**

We characterise how the lockdown and subsequent easing of restrictions affected trends in SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence.

**Methods**

On average, risk of infection is proportional to infection prevalence. The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study is a repeat cross-sectional study of over 98,000 people every round (rounds approximately monthly) that estimates infection prevalence in England. We used Bayesian P-splines to estimate prevalence and the time-varying reproduction number (*R~t~*) nationally, regionally and by age group from round 8 (beginning 6 January 2021) to round 13 (ending 12 July 2021) of REACT-1. As a comparator, a separate segmented-exponential model was used to quantify the impact on *R~t~* of each relaxation of restrictions.

**Results**

Following an initial plateau of 1.54% until mid-January, infection prevalence decreased until 13 May when it reached a minimum of 0.09%, before increasing until the end of the study to 0.76%. Following the first easing of restrictions, which included schools reopening, the reproduction number *R~t~* increased by 82% (55%, 108%), but then decreased by 61% (82%, 53%) at the second easing of restrictions, which was timed to match the Easter school holidays. Following further relaxations of restrictions, the observed *R~t~* increased steadily, though the increase due to these restrictions being relaxed was masked by the effects of vaccination and the rapid rise of Delta. There was a high degree of synchrony in the temporal patterns of prevalence between regions and age groups.

**Conclusion**

High-resolution prevalence data fitted to P-splines allowed us to show that the lockdown was highly effective at reducing risk of infection with school holidays/closures playing a significant part.

My work at RIVM focuses on using mathematical models of infectious disease transmission to determine the impact of vaccination strategies on disease spread, and the development of statistical methods to determine how vaccine-induced protection wanes over time. At the University of Hong Kong my work focuses on determining the real world protection provided by vaccines against respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19 and influenza.\nPrior to joining RIVM, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, where I was involved in modelling infectious disease dynamics, specifically developing individual-based mathematical models of susceptibility to determine how repeated exposures to pathogens (e.g., influenza) and interventions (e.g., vaccines) influence an individual's susceptibility to subsequent infections. I was also a member of the Imperial COVID-19 Response Team and actively involved in the modelling and characterisation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including as part of the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) studyanalytical team.\nI obtained a PhD in biostatistics from Emory University. My doctoral research focused on developing stochastic, agent-based models of infectious diseases and statistical methods to evaluate vaccine effectiveness from observational studies."

    "text": "Abstract\nEngland has experienced a large outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, disproportionately affecting people from disadvantaged and ethnic minority communities. It is unclear how much of this excess is due to differences in exposure associated with structural inequalities. Here, we report from the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) national study of over 100,000 people. After adjusting for test characteristics and re-weighting to the population, overall antibody prevalence is 6.0% (95% CI: 5.8-6.1). An estimated 3.4 million people had developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 by mid-July 2020. Prevalence is two- to three-fold higher among health and care workers compared with non-essential workers, and in people of Black or South Asian than white ethnicity, while age- and sex-specific infection fatality ratios are similar across ethnicities. Our results indicate that higher hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19 in minority ethnic groups may reflect higher rates of infection rather than differential experience of disease or care.\n\n\nCitation\nWard, H., Atchison, C., Whitaker, M. et al.

    "text": "Abstract\nThe global outbreak of monkeypox has spread to more than a hundred countries in non-endemic regions. One of the key determinants of the rapid growth is the serial interval, defined as the time interval between symptom onset in two successive cases. In this study, we estimated the serial interval by analyzing 109 pairs of laboratory-confirmed monkeypox in the Netherlands. After reviewing detailed exposure histories, we identified 34 pairs where the infectee reported a single potential infector. The mean serial interval for those 34 pairs was 10.1 days (95% CI: 6.6–14.7 days), suggesting a reproduction number between 1.3 and 1.6 during June 2022 in the Netherlands. Further investigation into pairs from one regional public health service revealed that pre-symptomatic transmission may have occurred in five out of eighteen pairs. These findings emphasize that precaution will remain key, regardless of the presence of recognizable symptoms, to anticipate possible resurgence of monkeypox.\n\n\nCitation\nFuminari Miura, Jantien A Backer, Gini van Rijckevorsel, Roisin Bavalia, Stijn Raven, Mariska Petrignani, Kylie EC Ainslie, Jacco Wallinga. 2022.

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground\nPrior infection with SARS-CoV-2 can provide protection against infection and severe COVID-19. In settings with high pre-existing immunity, vaccine effectiveness (VE) should decrease with higher levels of immunity among unvaccinated individuals. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to understand the influence of prior infection on VE.\nMethods\nWe included test-negative design (TND) studies that examined VE against infection or severe disease (hospitalization, ICU admission, or death) for primary vaccination series. To determine the impact of prior infections on VE estimates, we compared studies that excluded or included people with prior COVID-19 infection. We also compared VE estimates by the cumulative incidence of cases before the start of and incidence rates during each study in the study locations, as further measures of prior infections in the community.\nFindings\nWe identified 67 studies that met inclusion criteria. Pooled VE among studies that included people with prior COVID-19 infection was lower against infection (pooled VE: 77%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 72%, 81%) and severe disease (pooled VE: 86%; 95% CI: 83%, 89%), compared with studies that excluded people with prior COVID-19 infection (pooled VE against infection: 87%; 95% CI: 85%, 89%; pooled VE against severe disease: 93%; 95% CI: 91%, 95%). There was a negative correlation between the cumulative incidence of cases before the start of the study and VE estimates against infection (spearman correlation (ρ) = −0.32; 95% CI: −0.45, −0.18) and severe disease (ρ = −0.49; 95% CI: −0.64, −0.30). There was also a negative correlation between the incidence rates of cases during the study period and VE estimates against infection (ρ = - 0.48; 95% CI: −0.59, −0.34) and severe disease (ρ = −0.42; 95% CI: −0.58, −0.23).\nInterpretation\nBased on a review of published VE estimates we found clear empirical evidence that higher levels of pre-existing immunity in a population were associated with lower VE estimates. Excluding previously infected individuals from VE studies may result in higher VE estimates with limited generalisability to the wider population. Prior infections should be treated as confounder and effect modificatory when the policies were targeted to whole population or stratified by infection history, respectively.\n\n\nCitation\nTim Tsang, Sheena G Sullivan, Xiaotong Huang, Can Wang, Yifan Wang, Joshua Nealon, Bingyi Yang, Kylie EC Ainslie, Ben J Cowling. 2022.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nAfter experiencing a sharp growth in COVID-19 cases early in the pandemic, South Korea rapidly controlled transmission while implementing less stringent national social distancing measures than countries in Europe and the USA. This has led to substantial interest in their “test, trace, isolate” strategy. However, it is important to understand the epidemiological peculiarities of South Korea’s outbreak and characterise their response before attempting to emulate these measures elsewhere.\n\n\nMethods\nWe systematically extracted numbers of suspected cases tested, PCR-confirmed cases, deaths, isolated confirmed cases, and numbers of confirmed cases with an identified epidemiological link from publicly available data. We estimated the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, using an established Bayesian framework, and reviewed the package of interventions implemented by South Korea using our extracted data, plus published literature and government sources.\n\n\nResults\nWe estimated that after the initial rapid growth in cases, Rt dropped below one in early April before increasing to a maximum of 1.94 (95%CrI, 1.64–2.27) in May following outbreaks in Seoul Metropolitan Region. By mid-June, Rt was back below one where it remained until the end of our study (July 13th). Despite less stringent “lockdown” measures, strong social distancing measures were implemented in high-incidence areas and studies measured a considerable national decrease in movement in late February. Testing the capacity was swiftly increased, and protocols were in place to isolate suspected and confirmed cases quickly; however, we could not estimate the delay to isolation using our data. Accounting for just 10% of cases, individual case-based contact tracing picked up a relatively minor proportion of total cases, with cluster investigations accounting for 66%.\n\n\nConclusions\nWhilst early adoption of testing and contact tracing is likely to be important for South Korea’s successful outbreak control, other factors including regional implementation of strong social distancing measures likely also contributed. The high volume of testing and the low number of deaths suggest that South Korea experienced a small epidemic relative to other countries. Caution is needed in attempting to replicate the South Korean response in populations with larger more geographically widespread epidemics where finding, testing, and isolating cases that are linked to clusters may be more difficult.\n\n\n\nCitation\nDighe, A., Cattarino, L., Cuomo-Dannenburg, G. et al.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Since early March 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic across the United Kingdom has led to a range of social distancing policies, which have resulted in reduced mobility across different regions. Crowd level data on mobile phone usage can be used as a proxy for actual population mobility patterns and provide a way of quantifying the impact of social distancing measures on changes in mobility.\n\n\n\n\nHere, we use two mobile phone-based datasets (anonymised and aggregated crowd level data from O2 and from the Facebook app on mobile phones) to assess changes in average mobility, both overall and broken down into high and low population density areas, and changes in the distribution of journey lengths.\n\n\n\n\nWe show that there was a substantial overall reduction in mobility, with the most rapid decline on the 24th March 2020, the day after the Prime Minister’s announcement of an enforced lockdown. The reduction in mobility was highly synchronized across the UK. Although mobility has remained low since 26th March 2020, we detect a gradual increase since that time. We also show that the two different datasets produce similar trends, albeit with some location-specific differences. We see slightly larger reductions in average mobility in high-density areas than in low-density areas, with greater variation in mobility in the high-density areas: some high-density areas eliminated almost all mobility.\n\n\n\nThese analyses form a baseline from which to observe changes in behaviour in the UK as social distancing is eased and inform policy towards the future control of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Highlights\n\n: - Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study May–December 2020. - Randomly selected community samples measure SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in England.\n\n\nTrends in prevalence over time inferred using a Bayesian Penalised-spline (P-spline).\nTrends over time in the reproduction number and instantaneous growth rate quantified.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThe time-varying reproduction number (Rt) can change rapidly over the course of a pandemic due to changing restrictions, behaviours, and levels of population immunity. Many methods exist that allow the estimation of Rt from case data. However, these are not easily adapted to point prevalence data nor can they infer Rt across periods of missing data. We developed a Bayesian P-spline model suitable for fitting to a wide range of epidemic time-series, including point-prevalence data. We demonstrate the utility of the model by fitting to periodic daily SARS-CoV-2 swab-positivity data in England from the first 7 rounds (May 2020–December 2020) of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study. Estimates of Rt over the period of two subsequent rounds (6–8 weeks) and single rounds (2–3 weeks) inferred using the Bayesian P-spline model were broadly consistent with estimates from a simple exponential model, with overlapping credible intervals. However, there were sometimes substantial differences in point estimates. The Bayesian P-spline model was further able to infer changes in Rt over shorter periods tracking a temporary increase above one during late-May 2020, a gradual increase in Rt over the summer of 2020 as restrictions were eased, and a reduction in Rt during England’s second national lockdown followed by an increase as the Alpha variant surged. The model is robust against both under-fitting and over-fitting and is able to interpolate between periods of available data; it is a particularly versatile model when growth rate can change over small timescales, as in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This work highlights the importance of pairing robust methods with representative samples to track pandemics.\n\n\nCitation\nOliver Eales, Kylie E.C. Ainslie, Caroline E.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nThe time-concentrated nature of the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in England in March and April 2020 provides a natural experiment to measure changes in antibody positivity at the population level before onset of the second wave and initiation of the vaccination programme.\n\n\nMethods\nThree cross-sectional national surveys with non-overlapping random samples of the population in England undertaken between late June and September 2020 (REACT-2 study). 365,104 adults completed questionnaires and self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) tests for IgG against SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\nFindings\nOverall, 17,576 people had detectable antibodies, a prevalence of 4.9% (95% confidence intervals 4.9, 5.0) when adjusted for test characteristics and weighted to the adult population of England. The prevalence declined from 6.0% (5.8, 6.1), to 4.8% (4.7, 5.0) and 4.4% (4.3, 4.5), over the three rounds of the study a difference of -26.5% (-29.0, -23.8). The highest prevalence and smallest overall decline in positivity was in the youngest age group (18-24 years) at -14.9% (-21.6, -8.1), and lowest prevalence and largest decline in the oldest group (>74 years) at -39.0% (-50.8, -27.2). The decline from June to September 2020 was largest in those who did not report a history of COVID-19 at -64.0% (-75.6, -52.3), compared to -22.3% (-27.0, -17.7) in those with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed on PCR.\n\n\nInterpretation\nA large proportion of the population remained susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in England based on naturally acquired immunity from the first wave. Widespread vaccination is needed to confer immunity and control the epidemic at population level.\n\n\n\nResearch in context\n\nEvidence before this study\nThe proportion of individuals in a population with evidence of protective immunity against SARSCoV2 is an important determinant for ongoing transmission. Cross-sectional estimates of prevalence will be affected by previous infection and vaccination, but also the rate of loss of antibody following infection. In cohort studies of symptomatic individuals, there is evidence that antibody responses can remain high for at least six months after infection and national seroprevalence studies such as those in Iceland and Spain have given robust cross-sectional estimates of population antibody positivity. However, to date there have been no longitudinal population studies to monitor changes in prevalence of antibody responses over time including in people with mild or no symptoms.\n\n\nAdded value of this study\nThe first peak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England was concentrated between March and April 2020, followed by a five-month period of low transmission. This provided a unique opportunity for detailed exploration of factors associated with antibody positivity and longitudinal study of the population prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody positivity. This study is the first to demonstrate a decline in population prevalence of detectable IgG antibodies following a peak in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a fall of 25.6% over three months. The largest decline was seen in individuals aged 75 or older and those who did not report a history of symptomatic infection.\n\n\nImplications of all the available evidence\nLongitudinal studies of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic individuals are not representative of the infected population as a whole, approximately 1/3 of whom have asymptomatic or mild infection. The largest study of its kind, this study demonstrates a significant decline in population antibody positivity over 3 months, with higher rates of decline in those without symptomatic infection. Such trends need to be accounted for in future cross-sectional surveys of previous infection. In the absence of access to vaccination, waning antibody positivity is likely to be associated to an increased susceptibility to reinfection, as is the case with other endemic seasonal coronaviruses.\n\n\n\nCitation\nHelen Ward, Graham S.

This was more than twice the number of deaths reported in the next most severely impacted country. We jointly model the US epidemic at the state-level, using publicly available death data within a Bayesian hierarchical semi-mechanistic framework. For each state, we estimate the number of individuals that have been infected, the number of individuals that are currently infectious and the time-varying reproduction number (the average number of secondary infections caused by an infected person). We use changes in mobility to capture the impact that non-pharmaceutical interventions and other behaviour changes have on the rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We estimate that Rt was only below one in 23 states on 1st June. We also estimate that 3.7% [3.4%–4.0%] of the total population of the US had been infected, with wide variation between states, and approximately 0.01% of the population was infectious. We demonstrate good 3 week model forecasts of deaths with low error and good coverage of our credible intervals.\n\n\nCitation\nUnwin, H.J.T., Mishra, S., Bradley, V.C. et al.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nFollowing rapidly rising COVID-19 case numbers, England entered a national lockdown on 6 January 2021, with staged relaxations of restrictions from 8 March 2021 onwards.\n\n\nAim\nWe characterise how the lockdown and subsequent easing of restrictions affected trends in SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence.\n\n\nMethods\nOn average, risk of infection is proportional to infection prevalence. The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study is a repeat cross-sectional study of over 98,000 people every round (rounds approximately monthly) that estimates infection prevalence in England. We used Bayesian P-splines to estimate prevalence and the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) nationally, regionally and by age group from round 8 (beginning 6 January 2021) to round 13 (ending 12 July 2021) of REACT-1. As a comparator, a separate segmented-exponential model was used to quantify the impact on Rt of each relaxation of restrictions.\n\n\nResults\nFollowing an initial plateau of 1.54% until mid-January, infection prevalence decreased until 13 May when it reached a minimum of 0.09%, before increasing until the end of the study to 0.76%. Following the first easing of restrictions, which included schools reopening, the reproduction number Rt increased by 82% (55%, 108%), but then decreased by 61% (82%, 53%) at the second easing of restrictions, which was timed to match the Easter school holidays. Following further relaxations of restrictions, the observed Rt increased steadily, though the increase due to these restrictions being relaxed was offset by the effects of vaccination and also affected by the rapid rise of Delta. There was a high degree of synchrony in the temporal patterns of prevalence between regions and age groups.\n\n\nConclusion\nHigh-resolution prevalence data fitted to P-splines allowed us to show that the lockdown was effective at reducing risk of infection with school holidays/closures playing a significant part.\n\n\n\nAuthor Summary\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic in England there has been a high rate of testing. However, the case data obtained from this mass testing is prone to many biases due to changing testing rates and behaviours. The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study instead tests random subsets of the population of England for SARS-CoV-2, providing a relatively unbiased signal of infection prevalence over time. Here we present the temporal analysis of rounds 8–13 of REACT-1, running from January to July 2021. During this period a national lockdown was introduced in England, followed by the staged relaxation of restrictions. We find that the lockdown was highly effective at reducing levels of infection prevalence in England, with prevalence declining until mid-May. However, as restrictions were gradually relaxed the reproduction number, R, increased to greater than 1 (the threshold for epidemic growth) and infection prevalence once more entered a phase of growth. Analysis of the step-changes in R after each restriction relaxation highlighted the significant effect that school holidays/closures likely had on R over this period. Additionally, we found that increases in R were likely offset by the high rates of vaccination that were achieved by July 2021.\n\n\nCitation\nEales O, Wang H, Haw D, Ainslie KEC, Walters CE, Atchison C, et al. (2022) Trends in SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence during England’s roadmap out of lockdown, January to July 2021.

    "text": "Vaccination has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality resulting from rotavirus infection worldwide. However, rotavirus vaccine efficacy (VE) appears to wane over the first 2 years since vaccination, particularly in developing countries. Statistical methods for detecting VE waning and estimating its rate have been used in a few studies, but comparisons of methods for evaluating VE waning have not yet been performed. In this work we present and compare three methods – Durham’s method, Tian’s method, and time-dependent covariate (TDC) method – based on generalizations of the Cox proportional hazard model.\n\n\n\nWe developed a new stochastic agent-based simulation model to generate data from a hypothetical rotavirus vaccine trial where the protective efficacy of the vaccine may vary over time. Input parameters to the simulation model were obtained from studies on rotavirus infections in four developing countries. We applied each of the methods to four simulated datasets and compared the type-1 error probabilities and the powers of the resulting statistical tests. We also compared estimated and true values of VE over time.\n\n\n\nDurham’s method had the highest power of detecting true VE waning of the three methods. This method also provided quite accurate estimates of VE in each period and of the per-period drop in VE.\n\n\n\nDurham’s method is somewhat more powerful than the other two Cox proportional hazards model-based methods for detecting VE waning and provides more information about the temporal behavior of VE."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Highlights\nWhat did you want to address in this study?\nScenario modelling enables policy makers to consider a range of possible future outcomes of an event in their decisions. We wished to guide a policy decision to extend the COVID-19 vaccination programme to adolescents and children in the Netherlands in summer 2021, should new infection waves occur in late 2021 and early 2022.\nWhat have we learnt from this study?\nOur scenario modelling, done before the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant appeared, projected that extending vaccination to adolescents would reduce the rates of infections and severe disease in the population and extending it to children under 12 years old, would reduce these rates further. However, vaccination alone would not prevent future COVID-19 waves.\nWhat are the implications of your findings for public health?\nVaccination for children and adolescents was recommended while other measures such as mask-wearing remained. In hindsight, our approach was important, considering that Omicron emerged in late November 2021 and subsequent infection waves occurred. Scenario modelling can support future policy decisions on COVID-19 vaccine booster doses or inform on what one might expect in the event of the emergence of other variants.\n\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nSince the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines in late 2020 and throughout 2021, European governments have relied on mathematical modelling to inform policy decisions about COVID-19 vaccination.\nAim\nWe present a scenario-based modelling analysis in the Netherlands during summer 2021, to inform whether to extend vaccination to adolescents (12–17-year-olds) and children (5–11-year-olds).\nMethods\nWe developed a deterministic, age-structured susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model and compared modelled incidences of infections, hospital and intensive care admissions, and deaths per 100,000 people across vaccination scenarios, before the emergence of the Omicron variant.\nResults\nOur model projections showed that, on average, upon the release of all non-pharmaceutical control measures on 1 November 2021, a large COVID-19 wave may occur in winter 2021/22, followed by a smaller, second wave in spring 2022, regardless of the vaccination scenario. The model projected reductions in infections/severe disease outcomes when vaccination was extended to adolescents and further reductions when vaccination was extended to all people over 5 years-old. When examining projected disease outcomes by age group, individuals benefitting most from extending vaccination were adolescents and children themselves. We also observed reductions in disease outcomes in older age groups, particularly of parent age (30–49 years), when children and adolescents were vaccinated, suggesting some prevention of onward transmission from younger to older age groups.\nConclusions\nWhile our scenarios could not anticipate the emergence/consequences of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, we illustrate how our approach can assist decision making. This could be useful when considering to provide booster doses or intervening against future infection waves.\n\n\nCitation\nAinslie, Kylie E C, Backer, J A, de Boer, P T, van Hoek, A J, Klinkenberg, D, Korthals Altes, H, Leung, K Y, de Melker, H, Miura, F, and Wallinga, J. 2022.

After adjusting for age and other variables, vaccine effectiveness for the new variant averaged 55% in June and July of 2020.

    "text": "Community virus surveillance\nEven highly effective vaccines will not save us from the need to monitor severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) activity, perhaps for years to come. Public health institutions will need early warning of any uptick in cases to prepare and deploy interventions as required. Riley et al. developed a community-wide program that was designed to detect resurgence at low prevalence and has been used to track SARS-CoV-2 virus across England. In the four rounds of sampling from May to September 2020, almost 600,000 people representative of all communities were monitored. The results revealed the greatest prevalence among 18- to 24-year-olds, with increasing incidence among older age groups and elevated odds of infection among some communities. This testing approach offers a model for the type of real-time, country-wide population-based surveillance work that needs to be conducted to monitor SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\nAbstract\nSurveillance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has mainly relied on case reporting, which is biased by health service performance, test availability, and test-seeking behaviors. We report a community-wide national representative surveillance program in England based on self-administered swab results from ~594,000 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, regardless of symptoms, between May and the beginning of September 2020. The epidemic declined between May and July 2020 but then increased gradually from mid-August, accelerating into early September 2020 at the start of the second wave. When compared with cases detected through routine surveillance, we report here a longer period of decline and a younger age distribution. Representative community sampling for SARS-CoV-2 can substantially improve situational awareness and feed into the public health response even at low prevalence.\n\n\nCitation\nSteven Riley, Kylie EC Ainslie, Oliver Eales, Caroline E Walters, Haowei Wang, Christina Atchison, Claudio Fronterre, Peter J Diggle, Deborah Ashby, Christl A Donnelly, Graham Cooke, Wendy Barclay, Helen Ward, Ara Darzi, Paul Elliott.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Author Summary\nMany countries include annual vaccination of children against influenza in their vaccination programs. In the United Kingdom (UK), annual vaccination of children aged of 2 to 10 against influenza is recommended. However, little research has evaluated whether annual vaccination is the best strategy, while accounting for how past infection and vaccination may affect an individual’s susceptibility to infection in the current influenza season. Prior work has suggested that there may be a negative effect of repeated vaccination. In this work we developed a stochastic, individual-based model to assess the impact of repeated vaccination strategies on childhood infections. Specifically, we first compare annual vaccination to no vaccination and then annual vaccination to biennial (every other year) vaccination. We use the UK as our motivating example. We found that an annual vaccination strategy resulted in the fewest childhood infections, followed by biennial vaccination. The difference in number of childhood infections between the different vaccination strategies decreased when we introduced a penalty for repeated exposures. Our work confirms the value of annual vaccination in children, but also shows that similar benefits of vaccination can be obtained by implementing a biennial vaccination program, particularly when there is a negative effect of repeated vaccinations.\n\n\nCitation\nAinslie, K.

    "title": "Optimal vaccine allocation for COVID-19 in the Netherlands: A data-driven prioritization",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nFor the control of COVID-19, vaccination programmes provide a long-term solution. The amount of available vaccines is often limited, and thus it is crucial to determine the allocation strategy. While mathematical modelling approaches have been used to find an optimal distribution of vaccines, there is an excessively large number of possible allocation schemes to be simulated. Here, we propose an algorithm to find a near-optimal allocation scheme given an intervention objective such as minimization of new infections, hospitalizations, or deaths, where multiple vaccines are available. The proposed principle for allocating vaccines is to target subgroups with the largest reduction in the outcome of interest. We use an approximation method to reconstruct the age-specific transmission intensity (the next generation matrix), and express the expected impact of vaccinating each subgroup in terms of the observed incidence of infection and force of infection. The proposed approach is firstly evaluated with a simulated epidemic and then applied to the epidemiological data on COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Our results reveal how the optimal allocation depends on the objective of infection control. In the case of COVID-19, if we wish to minimize deaths, the optimal allocation strategy is not efficient for minimizing other outcomes, such as infections. In simulated epidemics, an allocation strategy optimized for an outcome outperforms other strategies such as the allocation from young to old, from old to young, and at random. Our simulations clarify that the current policy in the Netherlands (i.e., allocation from old to young) was concordant with the allocation scheme that minimizes deaths. The proposed method provides an optimal allocation scheme, given routine surveillance data that reflect ongoing transmissions. This approach to allocation is useful for providing plausible simulation scenarios for complex models, which give a more robust basis to determine intervention strategies.\n\n\nAuthor Summary\nVaccination is the key to controlling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the early stages of an epidemic, there is shortage of vaccines. Here, we propose an algorithm that computes an optimal vaccine distribution among groups for different intervention objective (e.g., minimizing new infections, hospitalizations, or deaths). This method is applicable even when multiple vaccines are available. Our results reveal that an allocation scheme optimized for one specific objective is not necessarily efficient for another, indicating the importance of determining the precise objective in the decision making process at the early phase of distributions. Often, data are scarce in the midst of an epidemics. The proposed method requires routine surveillance data on the number of cases to determine the best possible allocation of vaccines.\n\n\nCitation\nMiura F, Leung KY, Klinkenberg D, Ainslie KEC, Wallinga J (2021) Optimal vaccine allocation for COVID-19 in the Netherlands: A data-driven prioritization.

In response to the fast-growing epidemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei, China imposed strict social distancing in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 followed closely by similar measures in other provinces. These interventions have impacted economic productivity in China, and the ability of the Chinese economy to resume without restarting the epidemic was not clear.\n\n\n\nUsing daily reported cases from mainland China and Hong Kong SAR, we estimated transmissibility over time and compared it to daily within-city movement, as a proxy for economic activity.\n\n\n\nInitially, within-city movement and transmission were very strongly correlated in the five mainland provinces most affected by the epidemic and Beijing. However, that correlation decreased rapidly after the initial sharp fall in transmissibility. In general, towards the end of the study period, the correlation was no longer apparent, despite substantial increases in within-city movement. A similar analysis for Hong Kong shows that intermediate levels of local activity were maintained while avoiding a large outbreak. At the very end of the study period, when China began to experience the re-introduction of a small number of cases from Europe and the United States, there is an apparent up-tick in transmission.\n\n\n\nAlthough these results do not preclude future substantial increases in incidence, they suggest that after very intense social distancing (which resulted in containment), China successfully exited its lockdown to some degree. Elsewhere, movement data are being used as proxies for economic activity to assess the impact of interventions. The results presented here illustrate how the eventual decorrelation between transmission and movement is likely a key feature of successful COVID-19 exit strategies."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nEngland has experienced a third wave of the COVID-19 epidemic since the end of May, 2021, coinciding with the rapid spread of the delta (B.1.617.2) variant, despite high levels of vaccination among adults. Vaccination rates (single dose) in England are lower among children aged 16–17 years and 12–15 years, whose vaccination in England commenced in August and September, 2021, respectively. We aimed to analyse the underlying dynamics driving patterns in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence during September, 2021, in England.\n\n\nMethods\nThe REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study, which commenced data collection in May, 2020, involves a series of random cross-sectional surveys in the general population of England aged 5 years and older. Using RT-PCR swab positivity data from 100 527 participants with valid throat and nose swabs in round 14 of REACT-1 (Sept 9–27, 2021), we estimated community-based prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccine effectiveness against infection by combining round 14 data with data from round 13 (June 24 to July 12, 2021; n=172 862).\n\n\nFindings\nDuring September, 2021, we estimated a mean RT-PCR positivity rate of 0·83% (95% CrI 0·76–0·89), with a reproduction number (R) overall of 1·03 (95% CrI 0·94–1·14). Among the 475 (62·2%) of 764 sequenced positive swabs, all were of the delta variant; 22 (4·63%; 95% CI 3·07–6·91) included the Tyr145His mutation in the spike protein associated with the AY.4 sublineage, and there was one Glu484Lys mutation. Age, region, key worker status, and household size jointly contributed to the risk of swab positivity. The highest weighted prevalence was observed among children aged 5–12 years, at 2·32% (95% CrI 1·96–2·73) and those aged 13–17 years, at 2·55% (2·11–3·08). The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic grew in those aged 5–11 years, with an R of 1·42 (95% CrI 1·18–1·68), but declined in those aged 18–54 years, with an R of 0·81 (0·68–0·97). At ages 18–64 years, the adjusted vaccine effectiveness against infection was 62·8% (95% CI 49·3–72·7) after two doses compared to unvaccinated people, for all vaccines combined, 44·8% (22·5–60·7) for the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Oxford–AstraZeneca) vaccine, and 71·3% (56·6–81·0) for the BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) vaccine. In individuals aged 18 years and older, the weighted prevalence of swab positivity was 0·35% (95% CrI 0·31–0·40) if the second dose was administered up to 3 months before their swab but 0·55% (0·50–0·61) for those who received their second dose 3–6 months before their swab, compared to 1·76% (1·60–1·95) among unvaccinated individuals.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn September, 2021, at the start of the autumn school term in England, infections were increasing exponentially in children aged 5–17 years, at a time when vaccination rates were low in this age group. In adults, compared to those who received their second dose less than 3 months ago, the higher prevalence of swab positivity at 3–6 months following two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine suggests an increased risk of breakthrough infections during this period. The vaccination programme needs to reach children as well as unvaccinated and partially vaccinated adults to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and associated disruptions to work and education.\n\n\n\nCitation\nMarc Chadeau-Hyam, Haowei Wang, Oliver Eales, David Haw, Barbara Bodinier, Matthew Whitaker, Caroline E Walters, Kylie EC Ainslie, Christina Atchison, Claudio Fronterre, Peter J Diggle, Andrew J Page, Alexander J Trotter, Deborah Ashby, Wendy Barclay, Graham Taylor, Graham Cooke, Helen Ward, Ara Darzi, Steven Riley, Christl A Donnelly, Paul Elliott. 2022.

Mobility data represent an important proxy measure of social distancing, and here, we characterise the relationship between transmission and mobility for 52 countries around the world. Transmission significantly decreased with the initial reduction in mobility in 73% of the countries analysed, but we found evidence of decoupling of transmission and mobility following the relaxation of strict control measures for 80% of countries. For the majority of countries, mobility explained a substantial proportion of the variation in transmissibility (median adjusted R-squared: 48%, interquartile range - IQR - across countries [27–77%]). Where a change in the relationship occurred, predictive ability decreased after the relaxation; from a median adjusted R-squared of 74% (IQR across countries [49–91%]) pre-relaxation, to a median adjusted R-squared of 30% (IQR across countries [12–48%]) post-relaxation. In countries with a clear relationship between mobility and transmission both before and after strict control measures were relaxed, mobility was associated with lower transmission rates after control measures were relaxed indicating that the beneficial effects of ongoing social distancing behaviours were substantial.\n\n\nCitation\nNouvellet, P., Bhatia, S., Cori, A. et al.

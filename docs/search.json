    "title": "On the bias of estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness from the test-negative studies",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nEstimates of the effectiveness of influenza vaccines are commonly obtained from a test-negative design (TND) study, where cases and controls are patients seeking care for an acute respiratory illness who test positive and negative, respectively, for influenza infection. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates from TND studies are usually interpreted as vaccine effectiveness against medically-attended influenza (MAI). However, it is also important to estimate VE against any influenza illness (symptomatic influenza (SI)) as individuals with SI are still a public health burden even if they do not seek medical care. We present a numerical method to evaluate the bias of TND-based estimates of influenza VE with respect to MAI and SI. We consider two sources of bias: (a) confounding bias due to a (possibly unobserved) covariate that is associated with both vaccination and the probability of the outcome of interest and (b) bias resulting from the effect of vaccination on the probability of seeking care. Our results indicate that (a) VE estimates may suffer from substantial confounding bias when a confounder has a different effect on the probabilities of influenza and non-influenza ARI, and (b) when vaccination reduces the probability of seeking care against influenza ARI, then estimates of VE against MAI may be unbiased while estimates of VE against SI may be have a substantial positive bias.\n\n\nCitation\nAinslie KEC, Shi M, Haber M, Orenstein WA.

    "text": "Abstract\nThe ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a severe threat to public health worldwide. We combine data on demography, contact patterns, disease severity, and health care capacity and quality to understand its impact and inform strategies for its control. Younger populations in lower-income countries may reduce overall risk, but limited health system capacity coupled with closer intergenerational contact largely negates this benefit. Mitigation strategies that slow but do not interrupt transmission will still lead to COVID-19 epidemics rapidly overwhelming health systems, with substantial excess deaths in lower-income countries resulting from the poorer health care available. Of countries that have undertaken suppression to date, lower-income countries have acted earlier. However, this will need to be maintained or triggered more frequently in these settings to keep below available health capacity, with associated detrimental consequences for the wider health, well-being, and economies of these countries.\n\n\nCitation\nWalker PGT, Whittaker C, Watson OJ, Baguelin M, Winskill P, Hamlet A, Djafaara BA, Cucunubá Z, Olivera Mesa D, Green W, Thompson H, Nayagam S, Ainslie KEC, Bhatia S, Bhatt S, Boonyasiri A, Boyd O, Brazeau NF, Cattarino L, Cuomo-Dannenburg G, Dighe A, Donnelly CA, Dorigatti I, van Elsland SL, FitzJohn R, Fu H, Gaythorpe KAM, Geidelberg L, Grassly N, Haw D, Hayes S, Hinsley W, Imai N, Jorgensen D, Knock E, Laydon D, Mishra S, Nedjati-Gilani G, Okell LC, Unwin HJ, Verity R, Vollmer M, Walters CE, Wang H, Wang Y, Xi X, Lalloo DG, Ferguson NM, Ghani AC.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nThe association between COVID-19 vaccination and length of hospital stay may provide further insight into vaccination benefits, but few studies have investigated such associations in detail. We aimed to investigate the association between COVID-19 vaccination and length of hospital stay in COVID-19 patients during Omicron waves in Hong Kong, and explore potential predictors.\n\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective cohort study was conducted on local patients aged ≥60 years who were admitted due to COVID-19 infection in Hong Kong in 2022, from 1 February to 22 November, and with 28 days of follow-up since admission. The exposure was either not vaccinated; or having received 2/3/4 doses of CoronaVac (Sinovac); or 2/3/4 doses of BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Fosun Pharma/Pfizer). Length of stay in hospital was the main outcome. Accelerated failure time models were used to quantify variation in hospital stay for vaccinated compared with unvaccinated patients, accounting for age, sex, comorbidity, type of vaccine and number of doses received, care home residence and admission timing; stratified by age groups and epidemic waves.\n\n\nResults\nThis study included 32,398 patients aged 60 years and above for main analysis, their median (IQR) age was 79 (71-87) years, 53% were men, and 40% were unvaccinated. The patients were stratified by confirmation prior to or since 23 May 2022, resulting in a sample size of 15,803 and 16,595 in those two waves respectively. Vaccinated patients were found to have 13-39% shorter hospital stay compared to unvaccinated patients. More vaccine doses received were associated with shorter hospital stay, and BNT162b2 recipients had slightly shorter hospital stays than CoronaVac recipients.\n\n\nConclusions\nVaccination was associated with reduced hospital stay in breakthrough infections. Increased vaccination uptake in older adults may improve hospital bed turnover and public health outcomes especially during large community epidemics.\n\n\n\nCitation\nChen D, Cowling BJ, Ainslie KEC, Lin Y, Wong JY, Lau EHY, Wu P, Nealon J.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Community virus surveillance\nEven highly effective vaccines will not save us from the need to monitor severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) activity, perhaps for years to come. Public health institutions will need early warning of any uptick in cases to prepare and deploy interventions as required. Riley et al. developed a community-wide program that was designed to detect resurgence at low prevalence and has been used to track SARS-CoV-2 virus across England. In the four rounds of sampling from May to September 2020, almost 600,000 people representative of all communities were monitored. The results revealed the greatest prevalence among 18- to 24-year-olds, with increasing incidence among older age groups and elevated odds of infection among some communities. This testing approach offers a model for the type of real-time, country-wide population-based surveillance work that needs to be conducted to monitor SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\nAbstract\nSurveillance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has mainly relied on case reporting, which is biased by health service performance, test availability, and test-seeking behaviors. We report a community-wide national representative surveillance program in England based on self-administered swab results from ~594,000 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, regardless of symptoms, between May and the beginning of September 2020. The epidemic declined between May and July 2020 but then increased gradually from mid-August, accelerating into early September 2020 at the start of the second wave. When compared with cases detected through routine surveillance, we report here a longer period of decline and a younger age distribution. Representative community sampling for SARS-CoV-2 can substantially improve situational awareness and feed into the public health response even at low prevalence.\n\n\nCitation\nSteven Riley, Kylie EC Ainslie, Oliver Eales, Caroline E Walters, Haowei Wang, Christina Atchison, Claudio Fronterre, Peter J Diggle, Deborah Ashby, Christl A Donnelly, Graham Cooke, Wendy Barclay, Helen Ward, Ara Darzi, Paul Elliott.

We developed a dynamic probability model to evaluate bias of VE estimates from passive surveillance cohort, test-negative, and traditional case-control studies. The model includes 2 covariates (health status and health awareness) that might affect the probabilities of vaccination, developing ARI, and seeking medical care. Our results suggest that test-negative studies produce unbiased estimates of VE against medically attended influenza when: 1) Vaccination does not affect the probability of noninfluenza ARI; and 2) health status has the same effect on the probability of influenza and noninfluenza ARIs. The same estimate might be severely biased (i.e., estimated VE - true VE ≥ 0.20) for estimating VE against symptomatic influenza if the vaccine affects the probability of seeking care against influenza ARI. VE estimates from test-negative studies might also be severely biased for both outcomes of interest when vaccination affects the probability of noninfluenza ARI, but estimates from passive surveillance cohort studies are unbiased in this case. Finally, VE estimates from traditional case-control studies suffer from bias regardless of the source of bias.\n\n\nCitation\nAinslie KEC, Shi M, Haber M, Orenstein WA.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nWe present a flexible, open source R package designed to obtain biological and epidemiological insights from serological datasets. Characterising past exposures for multi-strain pathogens poses a specific statistical challenge: observed antibody responses measured in serological assays depend on multiple unobserved prior infections that produce cross-reactive antibody responses. We provide a general modelling framework to jointly infer infection histories and describe immune responses generated by these infections using antibody titres against current and historical strains. We do this by linking latent infection dynamics with a mechanistic model of antibody kinetics that generates expected antibody titres over time. Our aim is to provide a flexible package to identify infection histories that can be applied to a range of pathogens. We present two case studies to illustrate how our model can infer key immunological parameters, such as antibody titre boosting, waning and cross-reaction, as well as latent epidemiological processes such as attack rates and age-stratified infection risk.\n\n\nAuthor summary\nAntibody levels can determine previous exposure to a pathogen and how likely individuals are to be infected in the future. However, antibody concentrations change over time, and some pathogens are continually evolving. In such cases, individuals may be infected and vaccinated multiple times when their pre-existing immunity fails, leading to a wide range of antibody profiles. Traditional approaches to analyse such data do not typically account for this. In addition, studies collecting antibody data may be designed differently, but are often underpinned by similar biological processes. We developed a statistical method and accompanying software package to better understand the immunology and epidemiology of these complex systems using serological data. We present two case studies to demonstrate how our software package, serosolver, can be applied to different settings: i) the epidemiology of the 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus in Hong Kong and ii) historical patterns of A/H3N2 influenza infection in Guangzhou, China. These results demonstrate how modern analytical methods can reveal additional information from serological data that is otherwise missed using traditional approaches.\n\n\nCitation\nHay JA, Minter A, Ainslie KEC, Lessler J, Yang B, Cummings DAT, et al. (2020) An open source tool to infer epidemiological and immunological dynamics from serological data: serosolver.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nTest-negative (TN) studies have become the most widely used study design for the estimation of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) and are easily incorporated into existing influenza surveillance networks. We seek to determine the bias of TN-based VE estimates during a pandemic using a dynamic probability model. The model is used to evaluate and compare the bias of VE estimates under various sources of bias when vaccination occurs after the beginning of an outbreak, such as during a pandemic. The model includes two covariates (health status and health awareness), which may affect the probabilities of vaccination, developing influenza and non-influenza acute respiratory illness (ARI), and seeking medical care. Specifically, we evaluate the bias of VE estimates when (1) vaccination affects the probability of developing a non-influenza ARI; (2) vaccination affects the probability of seeking medical care; (3) a covariate (e.g. health status) is related to both the probabilities of vaccination and developing an ARI; and (4) a covariate (e.g. health awareness) is related to both the probabilities of vaccination and of seeking medical care. We considered two outcomes against which the vaccine is supposed to protect: symptomatic influenza and medically-attended influenza.\nWhen vaccination begins during an outbreak, we found that the effect of delayed onset of vaccination is unpredictable. VE estimates from TN studies were biased regardless of the source of bias present. However, if the core assumption of the TN design is satisfied, that is, if vaccination does not affect the probability of non-influenza ARI, then TN-based VE estimates against medically-attended influenza will only suffer from small (&lt;0.05) to moderate bias (≥0.05 and &lt;0.10). These results suggest that if sources of bias listed above are ruled out, TN studies are a valid study design for the estimation of VE during a pandemic.\n\n\nCitation\nAinslie KEC, Haber M, Orenstein WA.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe identification of genes with specific patterns of change (e.g. down-regulated and methylated) as phenotype drivers or samples with similar profiles for a given gene set as drivers of clinical outcome, requires the integration of several genomic data types for which an ‘integrate by intersection’ (IBI) approach is often applied. In this approach, results from separate analyses of each data type are intersected, which has the limitation of a smaller intersection with more data types. We introduce a new method, GISPA (Gene Integrated Set Profile Analysis) for integrated genomic analysis and its variation, SISPA (Sample Integrated Set Profile Analysis) for defining respective genes and samples with the context of similar, a priori specified molecular profiles. With GISPA, the user defines a molecular profile that is compared among several classes and obtains ranked gene sets that satisfy the profile as drivers of each class. With SISPA, the user defines a gene set that satisfies a profile and obtains sample groups of profile activity. Our results from applying GISPA to human multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines contained genes of known profiles and importance, along with several novel targets, and their further SISPA application to MM coMMpass trial data showed clinical relevance.\n\n\nCitation\nKowalski J, Dwivedi B, Newman S, Switchenko JM, Pauly R, Gutman DA, Arora J, Gandhi K, Ainslie K, Doho G, Qin Z, Moreno CS, Rossi MR, Vertino PM, Lonial S, Bernal-Mizrachi L, Boise LH.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nFollowing rapidly rising COVID-19 case numbers, England entered a national lockdown on 6 January 2021, with staged relaxations of restrictions from 8 March 2021 onwards.\n\n\nAim\nWe characterise how the lockdown and subsequent easing of restrictions affected trends in SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence.\n\n\nMethods\nOn average, risk of infection is proportional to infection prevalence. The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study is a repeat cross-sectional study of over 98,000 people every round (rounds approximately monthly) that estimates infection prevalence in England. We used Bayesian P-splines to estimate prevalence and the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) nationally, regionally and by age group from round 8 (beginning 6 January 2021) to round 13 (ending 12 July 2021) of REACT-1. As a comparator, a separate segmented-exponential model was used to quantify the impact on Rt of each relaxation of restrictions.\n\n\nResults\nFollowing an initial plateau of 1.54% until mid-January, infection prevalence decreased until 13 May when it reached a minimum of 0.09%, before increasing until the end of the study to 0.76%. Following the first easing of restrictions, which included schools reopening, the reproduction number Rt increased by 82% (55%, 108%), but then decreased by 61% (82%, 53%) at the second easing of restrictions, which was timed to match the Easter school holidays. Following further relaxations of restrictions, the observed Rt increased steadily, though the increase due to these restrictions being relaxed was offset by the effects of vaccination and also affected by the rapid rise of Delta. There was a high degree of synchrony in the temporal patterns of prevalence between regions and age groups.\n\n\nConclusion\nHigh-resolution prevalence data fitted to P-splines allowed us to show that the lockdown was effective at reducing risk of infection with school holidays/closures playing a significant part.\n\n\n\nAuthor Summary\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic in England there has been a high rate of testing. However, the case data obtained from this mass testing is prone to many biases due to changing testing rates and behaviours. The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study instead tests random subsets of the population of England for SARS-CoV-2, providing a relatively unbiased signal of infection prevalence over time. Here we present the temporal analysis of rounds 8–13 of REACT-1, running from January to July 2021. During this period a national lockdown was introduced in England, followed by the staged relaxation of restrictions. We find that the lockdown was highly effective at reducing levels of infection prevalence in England, with prevalence declining until mid-May. However, as restrictions were gradually relaxed the reproduction number, R, increased to greater than 1 (the threshold for epidemic growth) and infection prevalence once more entered a phase of growth. Analysis of the step-changes in R after each restriction relaxation highlighted the significant effect that school holidays/closures likely had on R over this period. Additionally, we found that increases in R were likely offset by the high rates of vaccination that were achieved by July 2021.\n\n\nCitation\nEales O, Wang H, Haw D, Ainslie KEC, Walters CE, Atchison C, et al. (2022) Trends in SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence during England’s roadmap out of lockdown, January to July 2021.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nThe time-concentrated nature of the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in England in March and April 2020 provides a natural experiment to measure changes in antibody positivity at the population level before onset of the second wave and initiation of the vaccination programme.\n\n\nMethods\nThree cross-sectional national surveys with non-overlapping random samples of the population in England undertaken between late June and September 2020 (REACT-2 study). 365,104 adults completed questionnaires and self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) tests for IgG against SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\nFindings\nOverall, 17,576 people had detectable antibodies, a prevalence of 4.9% (95% confidence intervals 4.9, 5.0) when adjusted for test characteristics and weighted to the adult population of England. The prevalence declined from 6.0% (5.8, 6.1), to 4.8% (4.7, 5.0) and 4.4% (4.3, 4.5), over the three rounds of the study a difference of -26.5% (-29.0, -23.8). The highest prevalence and smallest overall decline in positivity was in the youngest age group (18-24 years) at -14.9% (-21.6, -8.1), and lowest prevalence and largest decline in the oldest group (&gt;74 years) at -39.0% (-50.8, -27.2). The decline from June to September 2020 was largest in those who did not report a history of COVID-19 at -64.0% (-75.6, -52.3), compared to -22.3% (-27.0, -17.7) in those with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed on PCR.\n\n\nInterpretation\nA large proportion of the population remained susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in England based on naturally acquired immunity from the first wave. Widespread vaccination is needed to confer immunity and control the epidemic at population level.\n\n\n\nResearch in context\n\nEvidence before this study\nThe proportion of individuals in a population with evidence of protective immunity against SARSCoV2 is an important determinant for ongoing transmission. Cross-sectional estimates of prevalence will be affected by previous infection and vaccination, but also the rate of loss of antibody following infection. In cohort studies of symptomatic individuals, there is evidence that antibody responses can remain high for at least six months after infection and national seroprevalence studies such as those in Iceland and Spain have given robust cross-sectional estimates of population antibody positivity. However, to date there have been no longitudinal population studies to monitor changes in prevalence of antibody responses over time including in people with mild or no symptoms.\n\n\nAdded value of this study\nThe first peak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England was concentrated between March and April 2020, followed by a five-month period of low transmission. This provided a unique opportunity for detailed exploration of factors associated with antibody positivity and longitudinal study of the population prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody positivity. This study is the first to demonstrate a decline in population prevalence of detectable IgG antibodies following a peak in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a fall of 25.6% over three months. The largest decline was seen in individuals aged 75 or older and those who did not report a history of symptomatic infection.\n\n\nImplications of all the available evidence\nLongitudinal studies of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic individuals are not representative of the infected population as a whole, approximately 1/3 of whom have asymptomatic or mild infection. The largest study of its kind, this study demonstrates a significant decline in population antibody positivity over 3 months, with higher rates of decline in those without symptomatic infection. Such trends need to be accounted for in future cross-sectional surveys of previous infection. In the absence of access to vaccination, waning antibody positivity is likely to be associated to an increased susceptibility to reinfection, as is the case with other endemic seasonal coronaviruses.\n\n\n\nCitation\nHelen Ward, Graham S.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nAfter experiencing a sharp growth in COVID-19 cases early in the pandemic, South Korea rapidly controlled transmission while implementing less stringent national social distancing measures than countries in Europe and the USA. This has led to substantial interest in their “test, trace, isolate” strategy. However, it is important to understand the epidemiological peculiarities of South Korea’s outbreak and characterise their response before attempting to emulate these measures elsewhere.\n\n\nMethods\nWe systematically extracted numbers of suspected cases tested, PCR-confirmed cases, deaths, isolated confirmed cases, and numbers of confirmed cases with an identified epidemiological link from publicly available data. We estimated the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, using an established Bayesian framework, and reviewed the package of interventions implemented by South Korea using our extracted data, plus published literature and government sources.\n\n\nResults\nWe estimated that after the initial rapid growth in cases, Rt dropped below one in early April before increasing to a maximum of 1.94 (95%CrI, 1.64–2.27) in May following outbreaks in Seoul Metropolitan Region. By mid-June, Rt was back below one where it remained until the end of our study (July 13th). Despite less stringent “lockdown” measures, strong social distancing measures were implemented in high-incidence areas and studies measured a considerable national decrease in movement in late February. Testing the capacity was swiftly increased, and protocols were in place to isolate suspected and confirmed cases quickly; however, we could not estimate the delay to isolation using our data. Accounting for just 10% of cases, individual case-based contact tracing picked up a relatively minor proportion of total cases, with cluster investigations accounting for 66%.\n\n\nConclusions\nWhilst early adoption of testing and contact tracing is likely to be important for South Korea’s successful outbreak control, other factors including regional implementation of strong social distancing measures likely also contributed. The high volume of testing and the low number of deaths suggest that South Korea experienced a small epidemic relative to other countries. Caution is needed in attempting to replicate the South Korean response in populations with larger more geographically widespread epidemics where finding, testing, and isolating cases that are linked to clusters may be more difficult.\n\n\n\nCitation\nDighe, A., Cattarino, L., Cuomo-Dannenburg, G. et al.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nTest negative studies have been used extensively for the estimation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE). Such studies are able to estimate VE against medically-attended illness under certain assumptions. Selection bias may be present if the probability of participation is associated with vaccination or COVID-19, but this can be mitigated through use of a clinical case definition to screen patients for eligibility, which increases the likelihood that cases and non-cases come from the same source population. We examined the extent to which this type of bias could harm COVID-19 VE through systematic review and simulation. A systematic review of test-negative studies was re-analysed to identify studies ignoring the need for clinical criteria. Studies using a clinical case definition had a lower pooled VE estimate compared with studies that did not. Simulations varied the probability of selection by case and vaccination status. Positive bias away from the null (i.e., inflated VE consistent with the systematic review) was observed when there was a higher proportion of healthy, vaccinated non-cases, which may occur if a dataset contains many results from asymptomatic screening in settings where vaccination coverage is high. We provide an html tool for researchers to explore site-specific sources of selection bias in their own studies. We recommend all groups consider the potential for selection bias in their vaccine effectiveness studies, particularly when using administrative data.\n\n\nCitation\nSullivan, S.G., Khvorov, A., Huang, X. et al.

    "title": "A comparison of the test-negative and the traditional case-control study designs for estimation of influenza vaccine effectiveness under nonrandom vaccination",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nAs annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all U.S. persons aged 6 months or older, it is unethical to conduct randomized clinical trials to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). Observational studies are being increasingly used to estimate VE. We developed a probability model for comparing the bias and the precision of VE estimates from two case-control designs: the traditional case-control (TCC) design and the test-negative (TN) design. In both study designs, acute respiratory illness (ARI) patients seeking medical care testing positive for influenza infection are considered cases. In the TN design, ARI patients seeking medical care who test negative serve as controls, while in the TCC design, controls are randomly selected individuals from the community who did not contract an ARI.\n\n\nMethods\nOur model assigns each study participant a covariate corresponding to the person’s health status. The probabilities of vaccination and of contracting influenza and non-influenza ARI depend on health status. Hence, our model allows non-random vaccination and confounding. In addition, the probability of seeking care for ARI may depend on vaccination and health status. We consider two outcomes of interest: symptomatic influenza (SI) and medically-attended influenza (MAI).\n\n\nResults\nIf vaccination does not affect the probability of non-influenza ARI, then VE estimates from TN studies usually have smaller bias than estimates from TCC studies. We also found that if vaccinated influenza ARI patients are less likely to seek medical care than unvaccinated patients because the vaccine reduces symptoms’ severity, then estimates of VE from both types of studies may be severely biased when the outcome of interest is SI. The bias is not present when the outcome of interest is MAI.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe TN design produces valid estimates of VE if (a) vaccination does not affect the probabilities of non-influenza ARI and of seeking care against influenza ARI, and (b) the confounding effects resulting from non-random vaccination are similar for influenza and non-influenza ARI. Since the bias of VE estimates depends on the outcome against which the vaccine is supposed to protect, it is important to specify the outcome of interest when evaluating the bias.\n\n\n\nCitation\nShi, M., An, Q., Ainslie, K. et al.

    "text": "Abstract\n\nIntroduction\nInfluenza vaccination is regarded as the most effective way to prevent influenza infection. Due to the rapid genetic changes that influenza viruses undergo, seasonal influenza vaccines must be reformulated and re-administered annually necessitating the evaluation of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) each year. The estimation of influenza VE presents numerous challenges.\n\n\nAreas Covered\nThis review aims to identify, discuss, and, where possible, offer suggestions for dealing with the following challenges in estimating influenza VE: different outcomes of interest against which VE is estimated, study designs used to assess VE, sources of bias and confounding, repeat vaccination, waning immunity, population level effects of vaccination, and VE in at-risk populations.\n\n\nExpert Opinion\nThe estimation of influenza VE has improved with surveillance networks, better understanding of sources of bias and confounding, and the implementation of advanced statistical methods. Future research should focus on better estimates of the indirect effects of vaccination, the biological effects of vaccination, and how vaccines interact with the immune system. Specifically, little is known about how influenza vaccination impacts an individual’s infectiousness, how vaccines wane over time, and the impact of repeated vaccination.\n\n\n\nCitation\nAinslie KEC, Haber M, Orenstein WA.

My work at RIVM focuses on using mathematical models of infectious disease transmission to determine the impact of vaccination strategies on disease spread, and the development of statistical methods to determine how vaccine-induced protection wanes over time. At the University of Hong Kong my work focuses on determining the real world protection provided by vaccines against respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19 and influenza.\nPrior to joining RIVM, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, where I was involved in modelling infectious disease dynamics, specifically developing individual-based mathematical models of susceptibility to determine how repeated exposures to pathogens (e.g., influenza) and interventions (e.g., vaccines) influence an individual’s susceptibility to subsequent infections. I was also a member of the Imperial COVID-19 Response Team and actively involved in the modelling and characterisation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including as part of the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study analytical team.\nI obtained a PhD in biostatistics from Emory University. My doctoral research focused on developing stochastic, agent-based models of infectious diseases and statistical methods to evaluate vaccine effectiveness from observational studies."

Scabies affects over 400 million people annually worldwide, and a rise in scabies cases has been observed in recent years throughout Western Europe. Despite the prevalence of scabies, some fundamental epidemiological characteristics of scabies infections have not been described. In this project, we use publicly available data on date of symptom onset during scabies outbreaks to estimate the mean serial interval, time between symptom onset in an infector and symptom onset in an infectee, of scabies infection. We also use weekly counts of scabies diagnoses from sentinel surveillance in the Netherlands from 2011-2023 to determine quantities related to the spread of scabies over time, namely, the time-varying reproduction number, growth rate, and basic reproduction number.\n\nRelated links\n\nAinslie, K.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nFollowing the detection of the new coronavirus1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its spread outside of China, Europe has experienced large epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In response, many European countries have implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as the closure of schools and national lockdowns. Here we study the effect of major interventions across 11 European countries for the period from the start of the COVID-19 epidemics in February 2020 until 4 May 2020, when lockdowns started to be lifted. Our model calculates backwards from observed deaths to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks previously, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use partial pooling of information between countries, with both individual and shared effects on the time-varying reproduction number (Rt). Pooling allows for more information to be used, helps to overcome idiosyncrasies in the data and enables more-timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of some epidemiological parameters (such as the infection fatality rate), does not include importation or subnational variation and assumes that changes in Rt are an immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behaviour. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that are incomplete, show systematic biases in reporting and are subject to future consolidation. We estimate that—for all of the countries we consider here—current interventions have been sufficient to drive Rt below 1 (probability Rt &lt; 1.0 is greater than 99%) and achieve control of the epidemic. We estimate that across all 11 countries combined, between 12 and 15 million individuals were infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4 May 2020, representing between 3.2% and 4.0% of the population. Our results show that major non-pharmaceutical interventions—and lockdowns in particular—have had a large effect on reducing transmission. Continued intervention should be considered to keep transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control.\n\n\nCitation\nFlaxman, S., Mishra, S., Gandy, A. et al.

    "text": "Abstract\nEngland has experienced a large outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, disproportionately affecting people from disadvantaged and ethnic minority communities. It is unclear how much of this excess is due to differences in exposure associated with structural inequalities. Here, we report from the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) national study of over 100,000 people. After adjusting for test characteristics and re-weighting to the population, overall antibody prevalence is 6.0% (95% CI: 5.8-6.1). An estimated 3.4 million people had developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 by mid-July 2020. Prevalence is two- to three-fold higher among health and care workers compared with non-essential workers, and in people of Black or South Asian than white ethnicity, while age- and sex-specific infection fatality ratios are similar across ethnicities. Our results indicate that higher hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19 in minority ethnic groups may reflect higher rates of infection rather than differential experience of disease or care.\n\n\nCitation\nWard, H., Atchison, C., Whitaker, M. et al.

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground\nPrior infection with SARS-CoV-2 can provide protection against infection and severe COVID-19. In settings with high pre-existing immunity, vaccine effectiveness (VE) should decrease with higher levels of immunity among unvaccinated individuals. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to understand the influence of prior infection on VE.\nMethods\nWe included test-negative design (TND) studies that examined VE against infection or severe disease (hospitalization, ICU admission, or death) for primary vaccination series. To determine the impact of prior infections on VE estimates, we compared studies that excluded or included people with prior COVID-19 infection. We also compared VE estimates by the cumulative incidence of cases before the start of and incidence rates during each study in the study locations, as further measures of prior infections in the community.\nFindings\nWe identified 67 studies that met inclusion criteria. Pooled VE among studies that included people with prior COVID-19 infection was lower against infection (pooled VE: 77%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 72%, 81%) and severe disease (pooled VE: 86%; 95% CI: 83%, 89%), compared with studies that excluded people with prior COVID-19 infection (pooled VE against infection: 87%; 95% CI: 85%, 89%; pooled VE against severe disease: 93%; 95% CI: 91%, 95%). There was a negative correlation between the cumulative incidence of cases before the start of the study and VE estimates against infection (spearman correlation (ρ) = −0.32; 95% CI: −0.45, −0.18) and severe disease (ρ = −0.49; 95% CI: −0.64, −0.30). There was also a negative correlation between the incidence rates of cases during the study period and VE estimates against infection (ρ = - 0.48; 95% CI: −0.59, −0.34) and severe disease (ρ = −0.42; 95% CI: −0.58, −0.23).\nInterpretation\nBased on a review of published VE estimates we found clear empirical evidence that higher levels of pre-existing immunity in a population were associated with lower VE estimates. Excluding previously infected individuals from VE studies may result in higher VE estimates with limited generalisability to the wider population. Prior infections should be treated as confounder and effect modificatory when the policies were targeted to whole population or stratified by infection history, respectively.\n\n\nCitation\nTsang TK, Sullivan SG, Huang X, Wang C, Wang Y, Nealon J, Yang B, Ainslie KEC, Cowling BJ.

We aimed to quantify the extent to which disruptions to services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries with high burdens of these diseases could lead to additional loss of life over the next 5 years.\n\n\nMethods\nAssuming a basic reproduction number of 3·0, we constructed four scenarios for possible responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: no action, mitigation for 6 months, suppression for 2 months, or suppression for 1 year. We used established transmission models of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria to estimate the additional impact on health that could be caused in selected settings, either due to COVID-19 interventions limiting activities, or due to the high demand on the health system due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nResults\nIn high-burden settings, deaths due to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria over 5 years could increase by up to 10%, 20%, and 36%, respectively, compared with if there was no COVID-19 pandemic. The greatest impact on HIV was estimated to be from interruption to antiretroviral therapy, which could occur during a period of high health system demand. For tuberculosis, the greatest impact would be from reductions in timely diagnosis and treatment of new cases, which could result from any prolonged period of COVID-19 suppression interventions. The greatest impact on malaria burden could be as a result of interruption of planned net campaigns. These disruptions could lead to a loss of life-years over 5 years that is of the same order of magnitude as the direct impact from COVID-19 in places with a high burden of malaria and large HIV and tuberculosis epidemics.\n\n\nConclusions\nMaintaining the most critical prevention activities and health-care services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria could substantially reduce the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\nCitation\nHogan, Alexandra B et al. 2020.

Many methods exist that allow the estimation of Rt from case data. However, these are not easily adapted to point prevalence data nor can they infer Rt across periods of missing data. We developed a Bayesian P-spline model suitable for fitting to a wide range of epidemic time-series, including point-prevalence data. We demonstrate the utility of the model by fitting to periodic daily SARS-CoV-2 swab-positivity data in England from the first 7 rounds (May 2020–December 2020) of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study. Estimates of Rt over the period of two subsequent rounds (6–8 weeks) and single rounds (2–3 weeks) inferred using the Bayesian P-spline model were broadly consistent with estimates from a simple exponential model, with overlapping credible intervals. However, there were sometimes substantial differences in point estimates. The Bayesian P-spline model was further able to infer changes in Rt over shorter periods tracking a temporary increase above one during late-May 2020, a gradual increase in Rt over the summer of 2020 as restrictions were eased, and a reduction in Rt during England’s second national lockdown followed by an increase as the Alpha variant surged. The model is robust against both under-fitting and over-fitting and is able to interpolate between periods of available data; it is a particularly versatile model when growth rate can change over small timescales, as in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This work highlights the importance of pairing robust methods with representative samples to track pandemics.\n\n\nCitation\nOliver Eales, Kylie E.C. Ainslie, Caroline E.

We jointly model the US epidemic at the state-level, using publicly available death data within a Bayesian hierarchical semi-mechanistic framework. For each state, we estimate the number of individuals that have been infected, the number of individuals that are currently infectious and the time-varying reproduction number (the average number of secondary infections caused by an infected person). We use changes in mobility to capture the impact that non-pharmaceutical interventions and other behaviour changes have on the rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We estimate that Rt was only below one in 23 states on 1st June. We also estimate that 3.7% [3.4%–4.0%] of the total population of the US had been infected, with wide variation between states, and approximately 0.01% of the population was infectious.

    "text": "Highlights\nWhat did you want to address in this study?\nScenario modelling enables policy makers to consider a range of possible future outcomes of an event in their decisions. We wished to guide a policy decision to extend the COVID-19 vaccination programme to adolescents and children in the Netherlands in summer 2021, should new infection waves occur in late 2021 and early 2022.\nWhat have we learnt from this study?\nOur scenario modelling, done before the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant appeared, projected that extending vaccination to adolescents would reduce the rates of infections and severe disease in the population and extending it to children under 12 years old, would reduce these rates further. However, vaccination alone would not prevent future COVID-19 waves.\nWhat are the implications of your findings for public health?\nVaccination for children and adolescents was recommended while other measures such as mask-wearing remained. In hindsight, our approach was important, considering that Omicron emerged in late November 2021 and subsequent infection waves occurred. Scenario modelling can support future policy decisions on COVID-19 vaccine booster doses or inform on what one might expect in the event of the emergence of other variants.\n\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nSince the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines in late 2020 and throughout 2021, European governments have relied on mathematical modelling to inform policy decisions about COVID-19 vaccination.\nAim\nWe present a scenario-based modelling analysis in the Netherlands during summer 2021, to inform whether to extend vaccination to adolescents (12–17-year-olds) and children (5–11-year-olds).\nMethods\nWe developed a deterministic, age-structured susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model and compared modelled incidences of infections, hospital and intensive care admissions, and deaths per 100,000 people across vaccination scenarios, before the emergence of the Omicron variant.\nResults\nOur model projections showed that, on average, upon the release of all non-pharmaceutical control measures on 1 November 2021, a large COVID-19 wave may occur in winter 2021/22, followed by a smaller, second wave in spring 2022, regardless of the vaccination scenario. The model projected reductions in infections/severe disease outcomes when vaccination was extended to adolescents and further reductions when vaccination was extended to all people over 5 years-old. When examining projected disease outcomes by age group, individuals benefitting most from extending vaccination were adolescents and children themselves. We also observed reductions in disease outcomes in older age groups, particularly of parent age (30–49 years), when children and adolescents were vaccinated, suggesting some prevention of onward transmission from younger to older age groups.\nConclusions\nWhile our scenarios could not anticipate the emergence/consequences of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, we illustrate how our approach can assist decision making. This could be useful when considering to provide booster doses or intervening against future infection waves.\n\n\nCitation\nAinslie, Kylie E C, Backer, J A, de Boer, P T, van Hoek, A J, Klinkenberg, D, Korthals Altes, H, Leung, K Y, de Melker, H, Miura, F, and Wallinga, J. 2022.

Western Europe was initially one of the worst-hit regions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Western European countries deployed a range of policy responses to the pandemic, which were often informed by mathematical, computational, and statistical models. Models differed in terms of temporal scope, pandemic stage, interventions modeled, and analytical form. This diversity was modulated by differences in data availability and quality, government interventions, societal responses, and technical capacity. Many of these models were decisive to policy making at key junctures, such as during the introduction of vaccination and the emergence of the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants. However, models also faced intense criticism from the press, other scientists, and politicians around their accuracy and appropriateness for decision making. Hence, evaluating the success of models in terms of accuracy and influence is an essential task. Modeling needs to be supported by infrastructure for systems to collect and share data, model development, and collaboration between groups, as well as two-way engagement between modelers and both policy makers and the public.\n\n\nCitation\nJit M, Ainslie K, Althaus C, Caetano C, Colizza V, Paolotti D, Beutels P, Willem L, Edmunds J, Nunes B, Namorado S, Faes C, Low N, Wallinga J, Hens N.

    "text": "Abstract\nInfluenza vaccination is recommended as the best way to protect against influenza infection and illness. Due to seasonal changes in influenza virus types and subtypes, a new vaccine must be produced, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) must be estimated, annually. Since 2010, influenza vaccination has been recommended universally in the United States, making randomized clinical trials unethical. Recent studies have used a monitored household cohort study design to determine separate VE estimates against influenza transmission from the household and community. We developed a probability model and accompanying maximum likelihood procedure to estimate vaccine-related protection against transmission of influenza from the household and the community. Using agent-based stochastic simulations, we validated that we can obtain maximum likelihood estimates of transmission parameters and VE close to their true values. Sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of deviations from our assumptions were conducted. We used our method to estimate transmission parameters and VE from data from a monitored household study in Michigan during the 2012-2013 influenza season and were able to detect a significant protective effect of influenza vaccination against community-acquired transmission.\n\n\nCitation\nAinslie KEC, Haber MJ, Malosh RE, Petrie JG, Monto AS.

    "text": "Abstract\nThis perspective is part of an international effort to improve epidemiological models with the goal of reducing the unintended consequences of infectious disease interventions. The scenarios in which models are applied often involve difficult trade-offs that are well recognised in public health ethics. Unless these trade-offs are explicitly accounted for, models risk overlooking contested ethical choices and values, leading to an increased risk of unintended consequences. We argue that such risks could be reduced if modellers were more aware of ethical frameworks and had the capacity to explicitly account for the relevant values in their models. We propose that public health ethics can provide a conceptual foundation for developing this capacity. After reviewing relevant concepts in public health and clinical ethics, we discuss examples from the COVID-19 pandemic to illustrate the current separation between public health ethics and infectious disease modelling. We conclude by describing practical steps to build the capacity for ethically aware modelling. Developing this capacity constitutes a critical step towards ethical practice in computational modelling of public health interventions, which will require collaboration with experts on public health ethics, decision support, behavioural interventions, and social determinants of health, as well as direct consultation with communities and policy makers.\n\n\nCitation\nZachreson C, Savulescu J, Shearer FM, Plank MJ, Coghlan S, Miller JC, Ainslie KEC, Geard N.

We measured the predictive accuracy of individual trajectories against observations, using this in a weighted ensemble. We repeated this sequentially against increasing weeks of observed data. We evaluated these ensembles to reflect performance with varying observed data."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nIntroduction\nAnnual vaccination of children against influenza is a key component of vaccination programs in many countries. However, past infection and vaccination may affect an individual’s susceptibility to infection. Little research has evaluated whether annual vaccination is the best strategy. Using the United Kingdom as our motivating example, we developed a framework to assess the impact of different childhood vaccination strategies, specifically annual and biennial (every other year), on attack rate and expected number of infections.\n\n\nMethods and findings\nWe present a multi-annual, individual-based, stochastic, force of infection model that accounts for individual exposure histories and disease/vaccine dynamics influencing susceptibility. We simulate birth cohorts that experience yearly influenza epidemics and follow them until age 18 to determine attack rates and the number of infections during childhood. We perform simulations under baseline conditions, with an assumed vaccination coverage of 44%, to compare annual vaccination to no and biennial vaccination. We relax our baseline assumptions to explore how our model assumptions impact vaccination program performance.\nAt baseline, we observed less than half the number of infections between the ages 2 and 10 under annual vaccination in children who had been vaccinated at least half the time compared to no vaccination. When averaged over all ages 0–18, the number of infections under annual vaccination was 2.07 (2.06, 2.08) compared to 2.63 (2.62, 2.64) under no vaccination, and 2.38 (2.37, 2.40) under biennial vaccination. When we introduced a penalty for repeated exposures, we observed a decrease in the difference in infections between the vaccination strategies. Specifically, the difference in childhood infections under biennial compared to annual vaccination decreased from 0.31 to 0.04 as exposure penalty increased.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur results indicate that while annual vaccination averts more childhood infections than biennial vaccination, this difference is small. Our work confirms the value of annual vaccination in children, even with modest vaccination coverage, but also shows that similar benefits of vaccination may be obtained by implementing a biennial vaccination program.\n\n\n\nAuthor Summary\nMany countries include annual vaccination of children against influenza in their vaccination programs. In the United Kingdom (UK), annual vaccination of children aged of 2 to 10 against influenza is recommended. However, little research has evaluated whether annual vaccination is the best strategy, while accounting for how past infection and vaccination may affect an individual’s susceptibility to infection in the current influenza season. Prior work has suggested that there may be a negative effect of repeated vaccination. In this work we developed a stochastic, individual-based model to assess the impact of repeated vaccination strategies on childhood infections. Specifically, we first compare annual vaccination to no vaccination and then annual vaccination to biennial (every other year) vaccination. We use the UK as our motivating example. We found that an annual vaccination strategy resulted in the fewest childhood infections, followed by biennial vaccination. The difference in number of childhood infections between the different vaccination strategies decreased when we introduced a penalty for repeated exposures. Our work confirms the value of annual vaccination in children, but also shows that similar benefits of vaccination can be obtained by implementing a biennial vaccination program, particularly when there is a negative effect of repeated vaccinations.\n\n\nCitation\nAinslie, K.

    "title": "Optimal vaccine allocation for COVID-19 in the Netherlands: A data-driven prioritization",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nFor the control of COVID-19, vaccination programmes provide a long-term solution. The amount of available vaccines is often limited, and thus it is crucial to determine the allocation strategy. While mathematical modelling approaches have been used to find an optimal distribution of vaccines, there is an excessively large number of possible allocation schemes to be simulated. Here, we propose an algorithm to find a near-optimal allocation scheme given an intervention objective such as minimization of new infections, hospitalizations, or deaths, where multiple vaccines are available. The proposed principle for allocating vaccines is to target subgroups with the largest reduction in the outcome of interest. We use an approximation method to reconstruct the age-specific transmission intensity (the next generation matrix), and express the expected impact of vaccinating each subgroup in terms of the observed incidence of infection and force of infection. The proposed approach is firstly evaluated with a simulated epidemic and then applied to the epidemiological data on COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Our results reveal how the optimal allocation depends on the objective of infection control. In the case of COVID-19, if we wish to minimize deaths, the optimal allocation strategy is not efficient for minimizing other outcomes, such as infections. In simulated epidemics, an allocation strategy optimized for an outcome outperforms other strategies such as the allocation from young to old, from old to young, and at random. Our simulations clarify that the current policy in the Netherlands (i.e., allocation from old to young) was concordant with the allocation scheme that minimizes deaths. The proposed method provides an optimal allocation scheme, given routine surveillance data that reflect ongoing transmissions. This approach to allocation is useful for providing plausible simulation scenarios for complex models, which give a more robust basis to determine intervention strategies.\n\n\nAuthor Summary\nVaccination is the key to controlling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the early stages of an epidemic, there is shortage of vaccines. Here, we propose an algorithm that computes an optimal vaccine distribution among groups for different intervention objective (e.g., minimizing new infections, hospitalizations, or deaths). This method is applicable even when multiple vaccines are available. Our results reveal that an allocation scheme optimized for one specific objective is not necessarily efficient for another, indicating the importance of determining the precise objective in the decision making process at the early phase of distributions. Often, data are scarce in the midst of an epidemics. The proposed method requires routine surveillance data on the number of cases to determine the best possible allocation of vaccines.\n\n\nCitation\nMiura F, Leung KY, Klinkenberg D, Ainslie KEC, Wallinga J (2021) Optimal vaccine allocation for COVID-19 in the Netherlands: A data-driven prioritization.

Based on these data, we conducted descriptive analyses of the epidemic in the six most-affected provinces.\n\n\nResults\nSchool closures, travel restrictions, community-level lockdown, and contact tracing were introduced concurrently around late January but subsequent epidemic trends differed among provinces. Compared with Hubei, the other five most-affected provinces reported a lower crude case fatality ratio and proportion of critical and severe hospitalised cases. From March 2020, as the local transmission of COVID-19 declined, switching the focus of measures to the testing and quarantine of inbound travellers may have helped to sustain the control of the epidemic.\n\n\nConclusions\nAggregated indicators of case notifications and severity distributions are essential for monitoring an epidemic. A publicly available database containing these indicators and information regarding control measures is a useful resource for further research and policy planning in response to the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\n\n\nCitation\nHan Fu, Haowei Wang, Xiaoyue Xi, Adhiratha Boonyasiri, Yuanrong Wang, Wes Hinsley, Keith J.

However, estimating infection incidence requires an understanding of the persistence of RT-PCR swab-positivity in the community.\nMethods\nDuring round 8 of REACT-1 from 6 January to 22 January 2021, we collected up to two additional swabs from 896 initially RT-PCR positive individuals approximately 6 and 9 days after their initial swab.\nResults\nTest sensitivity and duration of positivity were estimated using an exponential decay model, for all participants and for subsets by initial N-gene cycle threshold (Ct) value, symptom status, lineage and age. A P-spline model was used to estimate infection incidence for the entire duration of the REACT-1 study. REACT-1 test sensitivity was estimated at 0.79 (0.77, 0.81) with median duration of positivity at 9.7 (8.9, 10.6) days. We found greater duration of positivity in those exhibiting symptoms, with low N-gene Ct values, or infected with the Alpha variant.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nEngland has experienced a third wave of the COVID-19 epidemic since the end of May, 2021, coinciding with the rapid spread of the delta (B.1.617.2) variant, despite high levels of vaccination among adults. Vaccination rates (single dose) in England are lower among children aged 16–17 years and 12–15 years, whose vaccination in England commenced in August and September, 2021, respectively. We aimed to analyse the underlying dynamics driving patterns in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence during September, 2021, in England.\n\n\nMethods\nThe REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study, which commenced data collection in May, 2020, involves a series of random cross-sectional surveys in the general population of England aged 5 years and older. Using RT-PCR swab positivity data from 100 527 participants with valid throat and nose swabs in round 14 of REACT-1 (Sept 9–27, 2021), we estimated community-based prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccine effectiveness against infection by combining round 14 data with data from round 13 (June 24 to July 12, 2021; n=172 862).\n\n\nFindings\nDuring September, 2021, we estimated a mean RT-PCR positivity rate of 0·83% (95% CrI 0·76–0·89), with a reproduction number (R) overall of 1·03 (95% CrI 0·94–1·14). Among the 475 (62·2%) of 764 sequenced positive swabs, all were of the delta variant; 22 (4·63%; 95% CI 3·07–6·91) included the Tyr145His mutation in the spike protein associated with the AY.4 sublineage, and there was one Glu484Lys mutation. Age, region, key worker status, and household size jointly contributed to the risk of swab positivity. The highest weighted prevalence was observed among children aged 5–12 years, at 2·32% (95% CrI 1·96–2·73) and those aged 13–17 years, at 2·55% (2·11–3·08). The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic grew in those aged 5–11 years, with an R of 1·42 (95% CrI 1·18–1·68), but declined in those aged 18–54 years, with an R of 0·81 (0·68–0·97). At ages 18–64 years, the adjusted vaccine effectiveness against infection was 62·8% (95% CI 49·3–72·7) after two doses compared to unvaccinated people, for all vaccines combined, 44·8% (22·5–60·7) for the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Oxford–AstraZeneca) vaccine, and 71·3% (56·6–81·0) for the BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) vaccine. In individuals aged 18 years and older, the weighted prevalence of swab positivity was 0·35% (95% CrI 0·31–0·40) if the second dose was administered up to 3 months before their swab but 0·55% (0·50–0·61) for those who received their second dose 3–6 months before their swab, compared to 1·76% (1·60–1·95) among unvaccinated individuals.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn September, 2021, at the start of the autumn school term in England, infections were increasing exponentially in children aged 5–17 years, at a time when vaccination rates were low in this age group. In adults, compared to those who received their second dose less than 3 months ago, the higher prevalence of swab positivity at 3–6 months following two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine suggests an increased risk of breakthrough infections during this period. The vaccination programme needs to reach children as well as unvaccinated and partially vaccinated adults to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and associated disruptions to work and education.\n\n\n\nCitation\nMarc Chadeau-Hyam, Haowei Wang, Oliver Eales, David Haw, Barbara Bodinier, Matthew Whitaker, Caroline E Walters, Kylie EC Ainslie, Christina Atchison, Claudio Fronterre, Peter J Diggle, Andrew J Page, Alexander J Trotter, Deborah Ashby, Wendy Barclay, Graham Taylor, Graham Cooke, Helen Ward, Ara Darzi, Steven Riley, Christl A Donnelly, Paul Elliott. 2022.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries have sought to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission by restricting population movement through social distancing interventions, thus reducing the number of contacts. Mobility data represent an important proxy measure of social distancing, and here, we characterise the relationship between transmission and mobility for 52 countries around the world. Transmission significantly decreased with the initial reduction in mobility in 73% of the countries analysed, but we found evidence of decoupling of transmission and mobility following the relaxation of strict control measures for 80% of countries. For the majority of countries, mobility explained a substantial proportion of the variation in transmissibility (median adjusted R-squared: 48%, interquartile range - IQR - across countries [27–77%]). Where a change in the relationship occurred, predictive ability decreased after the relaxation; from a median adjusted R-squared of 74% (IQR across countries [49–91%]) pre-relaxation, to a median adjusted R-squared of 30% (IQR across countries [12–48%]) post-relaxation. In countries with a clear relationship between mobility and transmission both before and after strict control measures were relaxed, mobility was associated with lower transmission rates after control measures were relaxed indicating that the beneficial effects of ongoing social distancing behaviours were substantial.\n\n\nCitation\nNouvellet, P., Bhatia, S., Cori, A. et al.

    "section": "Steps for Automating the Pipeline",
    "text": "Steps for Automating the Pipeline\n\n1. Create a YAML file\nThe first step is to create a YAML file that defines the schedule, tasks, and notifications for the pipeline. Here’s an example:\nname: my_data_pipeline\nschedule:\n  type: cron\n  cron: \"0 0 1,15 * *\"  # Runs on the 1st and 15th of every month at midnight\nstart_time: \"2024-12-01 00:00:00\"\ntask:\n  script: Rscript -e 'my_package::my_data_pipeline()'\n  working_dir: ~/Documents/my_package\n  retry_policy:\n    retries: 3\n    delay: 5m\nnotifications:\n  on_success:\n    - type: email\n      to: my.email@gmail.com\n  on_failure:\n    - type: email\n      to: my.email@gmail.com\nThe name field should be a descriptive name for your pipeline. The schedule field specifies when and how often the task should run, and using what scheduling mechanism (here, type: cron). start_time specifies the first time the pipeline is allowed to run, (here, December 1, 2024 at 12:00 AM). The task field defines the details of the task to execute. Specifically, script specifies the command to run the pipeline, working_dir specifies the directory to execute the script from, retry_policy specifies how retries are handled if the task fails, retries denotes the maximum number of retries (here, 3), and delay specifies the time delay between retries (here, 5 minutes). The notifications field configures notifications for task outcomes. Here, we configure maestro to send an email when the task succeeds (on_success) and when the task fails (on_failure).\n\n\n2. Wrap your pipeline into a function\nEnsure that your pipeline is encapsulated within a function, such as my_package::my_data_pipeline(), so that it can be executed with the appropriate arguments. There’s a good explanation of how to do this in the maestro README. Below is an example I took from the above README.\n\n#' Example ETL pipeline\n#' @maestroFrequency 1 day\n#' @maestroStartTime 2024-03-25 12:30:00\nmy_etl &lt;- function() {\n  \n  # Pretend we're getting data from a source\n  message(\"Get data\")\n  extracted &lt;- mtcars\n  \n  # Transform\n  message(\"Transforming\")\n  transformed &lt;- extracted |&gt; \n    dplyr::mutate(hp_deviation = hp - mean(hp))\n  \n  # Load - write to a location\n  message(\"Writing\")\n  write.csv(transformed, file = paste0(\"transformed_mtcars_\", Sys.Date(), \".csv\"))\n}\n\nAll of the pipeline tasks are wrapped in a function called my_etl(), which has some maestro-specific roxygen-style comments, namely @maestroFrequency and @maestroStartTimewhich indicate how frequently the pipeline should run and when it should strat, respectively. For more details, see here.\n\n\n3. Automate the pipeline using cron\nNext, you’ll need to create a Shell script and set up cron to run your pipeline at the specified frequencies.\n\nStep 3.1: Create a .sh file\nCreate a .sh file by first opening a text editor using the Mac terminal. I used the nano editor.\n\nnano my_script.sh\n\nAdd the text to the .sh file to execute the pipeline using Rscript:\n\n#!/bin/bash\nRscript -e \"system('maestro run /path/to/maestro.yaml')\"\n\nIf editing the text to the .sh file directly in the terminal with nano:\n\nPress CTRL + O to save. (the letter “O”, not zero)\nPress Enter to confirm the file name.\nPress CTRL + X to exit.\n\n\n\nStep 3.2: Make the .sh file executable\nRun the following command to make the script executable:\n\nchmod +x /path/to/run_pipeline.sh\n\n\n\nStep 3.3: Schedule the pipeline with cron\nOpen your crontab configuration using crontab -e in the terminal and adding a line to schedule the pipeline to run at the desired frequency. For example, to run it daily at midnight:\n\n0 0 * * * /path/to/run_pipeline.sh\n\nThe cron schedule is defined by five fields followed by the command to execute:\n\n* * * * * command_to_run\n- - - - -\n| | | | |\n| | | | +--- Day of the week (0 - 7, where both 0 and 7 represent Sunday)\n| | | +----- Month (1 - 12)\n| | +------- Day of the month (1 - 31)\n| +--------- Hour (0 - 23)\n+----------- Minute (0 - 59)\n\nThe different fields are defined as: 1. Minute: Specifies the minute of the hour (0-59). 2. Hour: Specifies the hour of the day (0-23, 24-hour clock). 3. Day of the Month: Specifies the day of the month (1-31). 4. Month: Specifies the month (1-12, or names like jan, feb). 5. Day of the Week: Specifies the day of the week (0-7, where both 0 and 7 represent Sunday).\nSpecial characters can be used to indicated: - *: Wildcard that means “every” (e.g., every minute, every hour). - ,: List separator (e.g., 1,15 means the 1st and 15th). - -: Range (e.g., 1-5 means days 1 through 5). - /: Step values (e.g., */5 means every 5 units, like every 5 minutes).\nHere are some examples:\n\n30 14 * * 1-5 /path/to/script.sh: Runs at 2:30 PM, Monday through Friday.\n0 0 1,15 * * /path/to/script.sh: Runs at midnight on the 1st and 15th of the month.\n*/10 * * * * /path/to/script.sh: Runs every 10 minutes.\n0 8-18/2 * * 1-5 /path/to/script.sh: Runs every 2 hours between 8 AM and 6 PM, Monday to Friday.\n\n\n\nStep 3.4: Verify the cron job\nOnce you’ve configured your chrontab, you can check that the cron job has been scheduled successfully by running:\n\ncrontab -l\n\n\n\n\n4. Run the pipeline manually\nBefore waiting for the first scheduled runtime, test that everything is set up correctly by manually running the .sh script in the terminal:\n\n/path/to/run_pipeline.sh \n\n\n\n5. Wait for the scheduled runtime\nOnce everything is working and verified, you can sit back and wait for the first official scheduled runtime. The pipeline will run automatically based on the cron schedule you’ve defined!"

    "text": "Conclusion\nThat’s it! After setting up the YAML file, wrapping the pipeline in a function, creating the .sh file, and scheduling the job with cron, your pipeline should run automatically at the intervals you’ve defined. Remember, maestro handles the pipeline’s internal orchestration, but cron or another scheduling system is what ensures the pipeline is triggered at the right frequency."

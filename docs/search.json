    "text": "I’m Kylie Ainslie, and I’m an infectious disease modeller at the Dutch National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and an Honorary Assistant Professor at the University of Hong Kong School of Public Health. My work at RIVM focuses on using mathematical models of infectious disease transmission to determine the impact of vaccination strategies on disease spread, and the development of statistical methods to determine how vaccine-induced protection wanes over time. At the University of Hong Kong my work focuses on determining the real world protection provided by vaccines against respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19 and influenza.\nPrior to joining RIVM, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, where I was involved in modelling infectious disease dynamics, specifically developing individual-based mathematical models of susceptibility to determine how repeated exposures to pathogens (e.g., influenza) and interventions (e.g., vaccines) influence an individual's susceptibility to subsequent infections. I was also a member of the Imperial COVID-19 Response Team and actively involved in the modelling and characterisation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including as part of the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) studyanalytical team.\nI obtained a PhD in biostatistics from Emory University. My doctoral research focused on developing stochastic, agent-based models of infectious diseases and statistical methods to evaluate vaccine effectiveness from observational studies."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe time-varying reproduction number (Rt) can change rapidly over the course of a pandemic due to changing restrictions, behaviours, and levels of population immunity. Many methods exist that allow the estimation of Rt from case data. However, these are not easily adapted to point prevalence data nor can they infer Rt across periods of missing data. We developed a Bayesian P-spline model suitable for fitting to a wide range of epidemic time-series, including point-prevalence data. We demonstrate the utility of the model by fitting to periodic daily SARS-CoV-2 swab-positivity data in England from the first 7 rounds (May 2020–December 2020) of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study. Estimates of Rt over the period of two subsequent rounds (6–8 weeks) and single rounds (2–3 weeks) inferred using the Bayesian P-spline model were broadly consistent with estimates from a simple exponential model, with overlapping credible intervals. However, there were sometimes substantial differences in point estimates. The Bayesian P-spline model was further able to infer changes in Rt over shorter periods tracking a temporary increase above one during late-May 2020, a gradual increase in Rt over the summer of 2020 as restrictions were eased, and a reduction in Rt during England’s second national lockdown followed by an increase as the Alpha variant surged. The model is robust against both under-fitting and over-fitting and is able to interpolate between periods of available data; it is a particularly versatile model when growth rate can change over small timescales, as in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This work highlights the importance of pairing robust methods with representative samples to track pandemics.\n\n\nCitation\nOliver Eales, Kylie E.C. Ainslie, Caroline E.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Research in context\n\nEvidence before this study\nThe proportion of individuals in a population with evidence of protective immunity against SARSCoV2 is an important determinant for ongoing transmission. Cross-sectional estimates of prevalence will be affected by previous infection and vaccination, but also the rate of loss of antibody following infection. In cohort studies of symptomatic individuals, there is evidence that antibody responses can remain high for at least six months after infection and national seroprevalence studies such as those in Iceland and Spain have given robust cross-sectional estimates of population antibody positivity. However, to date there have been no longitudinal population studies to monitor changes in prevalence of antibody responses over time including in people with mild or no symptoms.\n\n\nAdded value of this study\nThe first peak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England was concentrated between March and April 2020, followed by a five-month period of low transmission. This provided a unique opportunity for detailed exploration of factors associated with antibody positivity and longitudinal study of the population prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody positivity. This study is the first to demonstrate a decline in population prevalence of detectable IgG antibodies following a peak in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a fall of 25.6% over three months. The largest decline was seen in individuals aged 75 or older and those who did not report a history of symptomatic infection.\n\n\nImplications of all the available evidence\nLongitudinal studies of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic individuals are not representative of the infected population as a whole, approximately 1/3 of whom have asymptomatic or mild infection. The largest study of its kind, this study demonstrates a significant decline in population antibody positivity over 3 months, with higher rates of decline in those without symptomatic infection. Such trends need to be accounted for in future cross-sectional surveys of previous infection. In the absence of access to vaccination, waning antibody positivity is likely to be associated to an increased susceptibility to reinfection, as is the case with other endemic seasonal coronaviruses.\n\n\n\nCitation\nHelen Ward, Graham S.

    "text": "Author Summary\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic in England there has been a high rate of testing. However, the case data obtained from this mass testing is prone to many biases due to changing testing rates and behaviours. The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study instead tests random subsets of the population of England for SARS-CoV-2, providing a relatively unbiased signal of infection prevalence over time. Here we present the temporal analysis of rounds 8–13 of REACT-1, running from January to July 2021. During this period a national lockdown was introduced in England, followed by the staged relaxation of restrictions. We find that the lockdown was highly effective at reducing levels of infection prevalence in England, with prevalence declining until mid-May. However, as restrictions were gradually relaxed the reproduction number, R, increased to greater than 1 (the threshold for epidemic growth) and infection prevalence once more entered a phase of growth. Analysis of the step-changes in R after each restriction relaxation highlighted the significant effect that school holidays/closures likely had on R over this period. Additionally, we found that increases in R were likely offset by the high rates of vaccination that were achieved by July 2021.\n\n\nCitation\nEales O, Wang H, Haw D, Ainslie KEC, Walters CE, Atchison C, et al. (2022) Trends in SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence during England's roadmap out of lockdown, January to July 2021.

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground\nSince the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines in late 2020 and throughout 2021, European governments have relied on mathematical modelling to inform policy decisions about COVID-19 vaccination.\nAim\nWe present a scenario-based modelling analysis in the Netherlands during summer 2021, to inform whether to extend vaccination to adolescents (12–17-year-olds) and children (5–11-year-olds).\nMethods\nWe developed a deterministic, age-structured susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model and compared modelled incidences of infections, hospital and intensive care admissions, and deaths per 100,000 people across vaccination scenarios, before the emergence of the Omicron variant.\nResults\nOur model projections showed that, on average, upon the release of all non-pharmaceutical control measures on 1 November 2021, a large COVID-19 wave may occur in winter 2021/22, followed by a smaller, second wave in spring 2022, regardless of the vaccination scenario. The model projected reductions in infections/severe disease outcomes when vaccination was extended to adolescents and further reductions when vaccination was extended to all people over 5 years-old. When examining projected disease outcomes by age group, individuals benefitting most from extending vaccination were adolescents and children themselves. We also observed reductions in disease outcomes in older age groups, particularly of parent age (30–49 years), when children and adolescents were vaccinated, suggesting some prevention of onward transmission from younger to older age groups.\nConclusions\nWhile our scenarios could not anticipate the emergence/consequences of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, we illustrate how our approach can assist decision making. This could be useful when considering to provide booster doses or intervening against future infection waves.\n\n\nCitation\nAinslie, Kylie E C, Backer, J A, de Boer, P T, van Hoek, A J, Klinkenberg, D, Korthals Altes, H, Leung, K Y, de Melker, H, Miura, F, and Wallinga, J. 2022.

    "title": "Exponential growth, high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, and vaccine effectiveness associated with the Delta variant",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Structured Abstract\n\nBackground\nThe prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection continues to drive rates of illness and hospitalizations despite high levels of vaccination, with the proportion of cases caused by the Delta lineage increasing in many populations. As vaccination programs roll out globally and social distancing is relaxed, future SARS-CoV-2 trends are uncertain.\n\n\nMethods\nThe Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission–1 (REACT-1) study has been tracking the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in England since May 2020. The study involves obtaining a self-administered throat and nose swab for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from ~100,000 or more people during 2 to 3 weeks each month, based on random samples of the population in England at ages 5 years and above. As well as information on swab positivity, we collect demographic and other data on potential risk factors and (since January 2021) vaccination history. Prevalence estimates are weighted to be representative of the population of England as a whole. Here, we analyzed prevalence trends and their drivers using RT-PCR swab positivity data from REACT-1 round 12 (between 20 May and 7 June 2021) and round 13 (between 24 June and 12 July 2021). Response rates, defined as the percentage of invitees from whom we received a valid swab result, were 20.4% across all rounds and 13.4% and 11.7% for rounds 12 and 13, respectively.\n\n\nResults\nWe observed sustained exponential growth as the third wave in England took hold, with reproduction number R estimated at 1.44 (95% credible interval 1.20, 1.73) in round 12 and 1.19 (1.06, 1.32) in round 13, corresponding to an average doubling time of 11 days (7, 23 days) in round 12 and 25 days (15, >50 days) in round 13. This resulted in an increase in average weighted prevalence from 0.15% (0.12%, 0.18%) in round 12 (based on 135 positives out of 108,911 valid swabs) to 0.63% (0.57%, 0.69%) in round 13 (527 positives out of 98,233). The rapid growth across and within rounds appears to have been driven by complete replacement of the Alpha variant by Delta, and by the high prevalence in younger, less-vaccinated age groups: Among those aged 13 to 17 years, we observed an increase in weighted prevalence by a factor of 9 between round 12 [0.16% (0.08%, 0.31%)] and round 13 [1.56% (1.25%, 1.95%)]. In round 13, weighted prevalence among those who reported being unvaccinated [1.21% (1.03%, 1.41%)] was greater than for those who reported having had two doses of vaccine [0.40% (0.34%, 0.48%)] by a factor of 3; however, 44% of infections occurred in doubly vaccinated individuals, reflecting imperfect vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection after two doses despite high overall levels of vaccination.\nAmong participants aged 18 to 64 years, on the basis of self-reported vaccination status, we estimated VE against infection (adjusted for age, sex, region, ethnicity, and index of multiple deprivation) of 49% (95% confidence interval 22%, 67%) in round 13, rising to 58% (33%, 73%) when only strong positives [cycle threshold (Ct) values below 27] were considered. For the same age group, we estimated adjusted VE of 59% (23%, 78%) against symptomatic infection—that is, among those reporting one or more common COVID-19 symptoms in the month prior to testing (fever, loss or change of sense of smell or taste, new persistent cough). Ethnicity, household size, and local levels of deprivation, in addition to age, jointly contributed to the risk of higher prevalence of swab positivity.\n\n\nConclusion\nFrom the end of May to the beginning of July 2021 in England, where there was a highly successful vaccination campaign with high vaccine uptake, infections were increasing exponentially—driven by the Delta variant—with high infection prevalence among younger, unvaccinated individuals. Despite slower growth (or level or declining prevalence) during summer 2021 in the Northern Hemisphere, increased mixing in the presence of the Delta variant likely explains renewed growth that occurred in autumn 2021, even in populations with high levels of vaccination.\n\n\n\nAbstract\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections were rising during early summer 2021 in many countries as a result of the Delta variant. We assessed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction swab positivity in the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission–1 (REACT-1) study in England. During June and July 2021, we observed sustained exponential growth with an average doubling time of 25 days, driven by complete replacement of the Alpha variant by Delta and by high prevalence at younger, less-vaccinated ages. Prevalence among unvaccinated people [1.21% (95% credible interval 1.03%, 1.41%)] was three times that among double-vaccinated people [0.40% (95% credible interval 0.34%, 0.48%)]. However, after adjusting for age and other variables, vaccine effectiveness for double-vaccinated people was estimated at between ~50% and ~60% during this period in England. Increased social mixing in the presence of Delta had the potential to generate sustained growth in infections, even at high levels of vaccination.\n\n\nCitation\nPaul Elliott, David Haw, Haowei Wang, Oliver Eales, Caroline E Walters, Kylie EC Ainslie, Christina Atchison, Claudio Fronterre, Peter J Diggle, Andrew J Page, Alexander J Trotter, Sophie J Prosolek, COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium, Deborah Ashby, Christl A Donnelly, Wendy Barclay, Graham Taylor, Graham Cooke, Helen Ward, Ara Darzi, Steven Riley.

    "text": "Abstract\nSurveillance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has mainly relied on case reporting, which is biased by health service performance, test availability, and test-seeking behaviors. We report a community-wide national representative surveillance program in England based on self-administered swab results from ~594,000 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, regardless of symptoms, between May and the beginning of September 2020. The epidemic declined between May and July 2020 but then increased gradually from mid-August, accelerating into early September 2020 at the start of the second wave. When compared with cases detected through routine surveillance, we report here a longer period of decline and a younger age distribution. Representative community sampling for SARS-CoV-2 can substantially improve situational awareness and feed into the public health response even at low prevalence.\n\n\nCitation\nSteven Riley, Kylie EC Ainslie, Oliver Eales, Caroline E Walters, Haowei Wang, Christina Atchison, Claudio Fronterre, Peter J Diggle, Deborah Ashby, Christl A Donnelly, Graham Cooke, Wendy Barclay, Helen Ward, Ara Darzi, Paul Elliott.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Author Summary\nMany countries include annual vaccination of children against influenza in their vaccination programs. In the United Kingdom (UK), annual vaccination of children aged of 2 to 10 against influenza is recommended. However, little research has evaluated whether annual vaccination is the best strategy, while accounting for how past infection and vaccination may affect an individual’s susceptibility to infection in the current influenza season. Prior work has suggested that there may be a negative effect of repeated vaccination. In this work we developed a stochastic, individual-based model to assess the impact of repeated vaccination strategies on childhood infections. Specifically, we first compare annual vaccination to no vaccination and then annual vaccination to biennial (every other year) vaccination. We use the UK as our motivating example. We found that an annual vaccination strategy resulted in the fewest childhood infections, followed by biennial vaccination. The difference in number of childhood infections between the different vaccination strategies decreased when we introduced a penalty for repeated exposures. Our work confirms the value of annual vaccination in children, but also shows that similar benefits of vaccination can be obtained by implementing a biennial vaccination program, particularly when there is a negative effect of repeated vaccinations.\n\n\nCitation\nAinslie, K.

    "text": "Author Summary\nVaccination is the key to controlling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the early stages of an epidemic, there is shortage of vaccines. Here, we propose an algorithm that computes an optimal vaccine distribution among groups for different intervention objective (e.g., minimizing new infections, hospitalizations, or deaths). This method is applicable even when multiple vaccines are available. Our results reveal that an allocation scheme optimized for one specific objective is not necessarily efficient for another, indicating the importance of determining the precise objective in the decision making process at the early phase of distributions. Often, data are scarce in the midst of an epidemics. The proposed method requires routine surveillance data on the number of cases to determine the best possible allocation of vaccines.\n\n\nCitation\nMiura F, Leung KY, Klinkenberg D, Ainslie KEC, Wallinga J (2021) Optimal vaccine allocation for COVID-19 in the Netherlands: A data-driven prioritization.

    "text": "Abstract\n\nObjectives\nIn this data collation study, we aimed to provide a comprehensive database describing the epidemic trends and responses during the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) throughout the main provinces in China.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom mid-January to March 2020, we extracted publicly available data regarding the spread and control of COVID-19 from 31 provincial health authorities and major media outlets in mainland China. Based on these data, we conducted descriptive analyses of the epidemic in the six most-affected provinces.\n\n\nResults\nSchool closures, travel restrictions, community-level lockdown, and contact tracing were introduced concurrently around late January but subsequent epidemic trends differed among provinces. Compared with Hubei, the other five most-affected provinces reported a lower crude case fatality ratio and proportion of critical and severe hospitalised cases. From March 2020, as the local transmission of COVID-19 declined, switching the focus of measures to the testing and quarantine of inbound travellers may have helped to sustain the control of the epidemic.\n\n\nConclusions\nAggregated indicators of case notifications and severity distributions are essential for monitoring an epidemic. A publicly available database containing these indicators and information regarding control measures is a useful resource for further research and policy planning in response to the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\n\n\nCitation\nHan Fu, Haowei Wang, Xiaoyue Xi, Adhiratha Boonyasiri, Yuanrong Wang, Wes Hinsley, Keith J.
